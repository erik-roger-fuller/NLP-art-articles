      "{'title': 'For Russians Tired of ‘Swan Lake,’ a Contemporary Alternative (Published 2017)', 'unique_id': 74471, 'para': 'MOSCOW — Since the 19th century, Russia has been synonymous with classical ballet — the country of “Swan Lake” and “Sleeping Beauty.” The czars were avid consumers. So, too, were the Soviet leaders, who invariably dragged foreign dignitaries to the ballet to show off the prowess of larger-than-life dancers like Maya Plisetskaya , Ekaterina Maximova and Vladimir Vasiliev . But the glories of Russian ballet didn’t leave much space for the development of a strong modern or contemporary tradition. There was no Russian Martha Graham or Merce Cunningham. Since the 1990s, the country has been playing catch-up, with varying degrees of interest and success. The Bolshoi and Mariinsky have performed works by Twyla Tharp and William Forsythe. More recently Jean-Christophe Maillot created a production of “The Taming of the Shrew,” for the Bolshoi. And a small number of contemporary-dance festivals have introduced audiences to nonballet companies from abroad. Into this burgeoning field has come Diana Vishneva, the star ballerina who for years divided her time between the Mariinsky Ballet in St. Petersburg and American Ballet Theater in New York. (She retired from Ballet Theater in June.) In recent years, she has shown a keen interest in a more contemporary repertory, and in 2013, she founded Context, a festival devoted to contemporary dance. “At the beginning, of course, there was resistance to this idea,” she said recently over tea at the gigantic Metropol Hotel here, across from the Bolshoi — and steps from the Kremlin. “They were questioning why a classical dancer is doing this.” But Ms. Vishneva said she had a mission to foster homegrown talent. Though most of the choreographers presenting work at the festival are non-Russians, one of its main features is a choreographic competition and showcase for Russian dance makers. More than a hundred applied this year from all over the county. Five years ago, the festival consisted of three days of performances in small theaters in Moscow — by any measure, its growth has been remarkable. This year’s edition, held in Moscow and St. Petersburg, filled eight days, with multiple daily performances, master classes, talks and film screenings. Featured artists included the German troupe Gauthier Dance and the British choreographer Wayne McGregor’s company. The much-loved ballerina Alessandra Ferri and Herman Cornejo, a star of American Ballet Theater, appeared, in a pas de deux created for them, also by Mr. McGregor. And for the first time a work by the American Justin Peck was performed in Russia. “It has pushed all the other festivals aside,” the prominent Moscow critic Tatyana Kuznetsova said in an interview in a cafe here on a rainy afternoon . “Contemporary dance is popular in Russia right now, and Diana Vishneva is very well known, more than the heads of other festivals.” As Ms. Kuznetsova points out, Ms. Vishneva’sefforts are timely: “People are fed up with ‘Swan Lake.’” And Ms. Vishneva is well placed to offer an alternative. Not only does she have the contacts with companies and choreographers all over the world, but she also has the kind of glamour and renown that attracts attention — and, no less importantly, sponsors. Most of the Context performances I attended in Moscow were packed. There were roving society photographers and selfie walls. At one performance, statuesque couples posed with a pair of Genesis luxury sedans; at another, Sberbank gave away fancy chocolate truffles. And while some people complained of the high price of tickets, Konstantin Selinevich, Ms. Vishneva’s husband and close collaborator, insisted that there are always low-priced tickets available for students and dancers. The glamour and buzz, Ms. Vishneva said, serve a higher purpose: the quest to encourage young choreographic talent within Russia, which has lagged behind Western Europe and the United States. (Both the Bolshoi and the Mariinsky, the country’s two top companies, now have choreographic workshops.) “It would be next to impossible for them to come to the Bolshoi and present something a bit uncooked, a bit raw.” The winners are awarded scholarships, commissions for new works, or sometimes opportunities to have their pieces performed abroad. Ms. Vishneva takes an avid interest in their development. “We give them feedback,” she said. “We stay in touch.” Ms. Vishneva, who has final say in the competition, has also championed work by women. The winners for the last two years have been women, Olga Vasilieva (2016) and Olga Labovkina (2017). Ms. Vishneva will present Ms. Vasilieva’s latest work, “The Room,” at the Holland Dance Festival next February. “We live in a woman’s age,” Ms. Vishneva said, with a smile. At least one of her picks has gone on to make his mark: Vladimir Varnava, the first winner, in 2013. Now 29, he is considered one of the most promising young choreographers in Russia. This year he created a ballet, “Yaroslavna. The Eclipse,” for the Mariinsky, set to a score by the Soviet composer Boris Tishchenko. Mr. Varnava is an interesting case; a dancer and choreographer who comes from the very fringes of Russian culture. He grew up in Kurgan, a town in the Urals, on the border with Kazakhstan. “Imagine a town that was all about agriculture and had a factory that produced tanks for the army,” he said between festival rehearsals. “But then, after the war, there was less demand, and it was slowly decaying.” He started out at a small studio run by a young couple; the wife had some ballet training, the husband was a folk dancer. Their inspiration often came from television and music videos. “We were inspired by some Western tendencies, like Michael Jackson, or shows like ‘Riverdance,’” he said. “It was all patched together.” But there was no connection between what he was doing and the larger world of contemporary dance. It wasn’t until he saw a video of a production by the French choreographer Angelin Preljocaj on YouTube, he said, that he realized what he was missing. He went to Paris to study for a year. Mr. Varnava’s work was featured as part of a triple bill of Stravinsky ballets — all by Russian choreographers — at the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Theater , a house of moderate size. (All three works were performed by the Perm Ballet.) Mr. Varnava tackled the well-known ballet “Petrushka.” His staging was imaginative and musically sensitive, the action set in a circus where the wobbly-kneed protagonist vied with a cartoonish strongman for the attentions of a Carmen Miranda-esque beauty. The Stravinsky evening turned out to be a high point of the festival, thrillingly theatrical and choreographically rich. The opener, “The Fairy’s Kiss,” was like a pop-up children’s book version of a ballet, complete with a colorful windmill and puffy storybook clouds. Filled with stomping folk dances and lively pointwork, the choreography had an unmannered, almost naïve quality. The style suited both the story — about a boy who falls in love with a local girl but is spirited away by a fairy — and Stravinsky’s music, which draws liberally from various Tchaikovsky melodies. The choreographer, Viacheslav Samodurov, was once a Mariinsky star, and Ms. Vishneva’s partner. (Third on the bill was a kind of dance-history pageant by Alexey Miroshnichenko, set to the music of “Firebird.”) Not all of the festival programs were satisfying. The opening gala was hit or miss, and a premiere, by Goyo Montero — the festival’s first commission — relied on well-worn clichés of contemporary dance. A semiabstract evening-length work about Nijinsky by Marco Goecke proved repetitive and so narratively opaque that it required spoken text to clarify the stage action. But there is hope for contemporary dance in Russia. A new generation of dance makers, little known in the West, is clearly on the rise, encouraged by festivals like Context, and choreographic workshops at the major companies. Ms. Vishneva’s efforts are creating momentum. And her ambitions continue to grow. Soon, she hopes to expand her operations beyond Moscow and St. Petersburg: “We have been talking to people in Yekaterinburg and across Russia.” Considering what she’s accomplished so far, the odds would seem in her favor.', 'author': None, 'url': ['https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/arts/dance/diana-vishneva-context-festival-contemporary-dance-in-russia.html'], 'tags': None, 'captions': ['The Perm Ballet performed “The Firebird”, choreographed by Alexey Miroshnichenko, part of the Stravinsky triple bill at the Context festival.', 'Diana Vishneva, the founder of the Context festival, at the Mossovet Theater in Moscow before the performance of “Nijinsky.”', 'The Perm Ballet performing “The Fairy’s Kiss,” choreographed by Viacheslav Samodurov.', 'Members of the Perm Ballet preparing for “Petrushka,” part of the triple bill of Stravinsky ballets at the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Theater in Moscow.', 'Members of the Perm Ballet performed “Petrushka,” choreographed by Vladimir Varnava.', 'Preparing for “Petrushka,” choreographed by Vladimir Varnava, part of the Stravinsky triple bill.', 'Alessandra Ferri and Herman Cornejo performed Wayne McGregor’s “Witness,” as part of Context.', 'Members of Gauthier Dance in Marko Goecke’s “Nijinsky” at the Mossovet Theater in Moscow.'], 'pubtime': datetime.datetime(2017, 12, 15, 0, 0), 'source': 'Nytimes_Arts'}\n",

      "{'title': 'All the Trappings of Victorious Headhunters (Published 2013)', 'unique_id': 19230, 'para': 'It would be hard to imagine a more misleading title than “Fiercely Modern: Art of the Naga Warrior,” the name of a show at the Rubin Museum of Art. The Naga, a diverse collection of peoples speaking similar languages and residing in a mountainous area in northeastern India, certainly were fierce. Headhunting was one of their prized pursuits. But they were far from modern by present-day standards. In fact, the culture of the Naga was nearly destroyed by modern Europeans. First came mid-19-century subjugation by the British, who wanted to stop the irritation of headhunting raids on neighboring Indian territories. Then American Baptist missionaries invaded, eventually succeeding in almost totally suppressing the Naga’s “satanic” practices and converting nearly all of the population to nominal Christianity. Including clothing, jewelry, weapons and ceremonial objects, the Rubin’s exhibition serves more as an enticing introduction than a deep and wide exploration of its subject. It was drawn from a collection assembled in the 1930s by the anthropologist Christoph von Fürer-Haimendorf  and now owned by the Welt Museum Wien in Vienna (previously the Museum für Völkerkunde). The exhibition’s most attractive objects are those worn by warriors, including bracelets, chest pieces and elaborate ceremonial headdresses made from metal, beads, feathers, animal bones and teeth, dyed hair and fur. Many are extraordinarily beautiful and positively flamboyant. Wonderfully imaginative hats rigged with extensions from which hang feathers, hair and other richly colored materials have a surrealistic and sometimes comical appearance that might have inspired Dr. Seuss. To contemporary Western eyes, however, the most sophisticated works are the shawls and wrap skirts, which, in the Naga’s strict division of labor, were woven exclusively by women. (Basketry was the men’s purview, and the show includes some impressive examples of that craft.) With their stripes, grids and zigzagging lines producing rhythmic geometric patterns, the textiles on view look as if they were designed by a mid-20th-century Modernist like Anni Albers . The Naga were not just aesthetes, however. The things they made were loaded with codified meanings. Motifs woven into shawls and skirts could be read by others as indicators of identity, status, family relations and notable accomplishments. A striking example consists of gridded red and black squares and stripes. The museum label explains: “The large black boxes on each end represent the dark side of life, which could be made brighter only through headhunting and hosting feasts of merit. The red squares represent the parts of flesh distributed to the community after a successful headhunt, and the red on the edges commemorates the blood that has been spilled.” For a modern viewer it is hard to fathom that something so lovely should be designed to celebrate such an abhorrent practice. The grisly style of a “Head Trophy” on display seems more appropriate. It consists of a series of woven rattan spheres hanging in a line ending at the bottom with a pair of human skulls, one of which has bull’s horns attached to each side. The horns, notes the museum label, were supposed to make the victim “deaf to the calls of his own community asking for the name of the man who had killed him.” While this head trophy has a bracing and disturbing ugliness, what is more shocking is that headhunting was so thoroughly woven into the fabric of Naga culture at every level. Successful headhunters were like star athletes, admired by all and especially attractive to women. “A young man who had yet to bag a head would be teased by the girls in his clan, and simply ignored by those in other clans,” notes the introduction to “Naga Identities: Changing Local Cultures in the Northeast of India,” a book of scholarly essays sold in the museum bookstore and a must for anyone who wants to know more about the Naga. (There is no catalog for this show.) More important, the Naga believed that bringing home heads would ensure the prosperity and general happiness of their village. It was important, for example, to consecrate with fresh heads the giant dugout log drums they made and used as musical instruments and as communication devices. On the other hand, daily life was not oriented around headhunting. It was an occasional activity pursued when villagers felt a need for community uplift. An old, former headhunter quoted in “Naga Identities” said, “Headhunting, that was like Christmas!” Mostly the Naga devoted themselves to the less sensational practices of farming and constructing mountainside villages of considerable complexity. Old photographs in “Naga Identities” show big thatched-roof houses outfitted with monumental wooden sculptures. The Rubin’s show gives but an intriguing glimpse of how highly developed Naga culture was. Since World War II, Nagaland has been rived by continuous violent conflicts between the Indian government and groups seeking independence and, internally, between radical and conservative factions. To the extent that the old Naga culture survives today, it is in the form mostly of nostalgic revivals catering to tourists. Younger Nagas generally are more interested in assimilating into Western consumer and entertainment cultures than in connecting to their precolonial roots. As it does everywhere in the world, modernity rolls on, fiercely.', 'author': None, 'url': ['https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/28/arts/design/naga-peoples-made-beauty-from-the-ugly-in-northeastern-india.html'], 'tags': None, 'captions': ['Tomb figures wearing bracelets, chest pieces and headdresses made of beads, feathers, animal bones and teeth.', 'Erotic figures in “Fiercely Modern: Art of the Naga Warrior.\"', 'A human head trophy in “Fiercely Modern: Art of the Naga Warrior.\"'], 'pubtime': datetime.datetime(2013, 6, 27, 0, 0), 'source': 'Nytimes_Arts'}\n",

      "{'title': 'Gabriel García Márquez’s Archive Freely Available Online (Published 2017)', 'unique_id': 35455, 'para': 'When Gabriel García Márquez’s archive was sold to the University of Texas two years ago, some decried the fact that the literary remains of Latin America’s foremost novelist — and a fierce critic of American imperialism — had come to rest in the United States. But now, the university’s Harry Ransom Center has digitized and made freely available about half of the collection, making some 27,000 page scans and other images visible to anyone in the world with an internet connection. The online archive , which is cataloged both in English and in Spanish, includes drafts and other material relating to all of García Márquez’s major books, including “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” which turned the Colombia-born writer into a global figure. There are also previously unseen photographs, notebooks, scrapbooks, screenplays and personal ephemera, like a collection of his passports. Many archives are digitizing their holdings. But to make so much material from a writer whose work is still under copyright freely available online is unusual. “Often estates take a restrictive view of their intellectual property, believing scholarly use threatens or diminishes commercial interests,” Steve Enniss, the director of the Ransom Center, said. “We are grateful to Gabo’s family for unlocking his archive and recognizing this work as another form of service to his readers everywhere.” Seeing some items in the archive, which the Ransom Center bought for $2.2 million, will still require a trip to Texas. The digital collection does not include any of the 10 drafts of García Márquez’s final, unfinished novel, “We’ll See Each Other in August.” (One chapter of the novel was published in the Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia in 2014, shortly after García Márquez’s death at age 87; the estate said via email that it has no further plans for publication.) But online readers can access a 32-page draft section of the projected second volume of García Márquez’s memoirs, which would have covered the years after he moved to Europe and then Mexico City, where he wrote “One Hundred Years of Solitude” and lived until his death. They can also use a special viewer to make side-by-side comparisons of different drafts of various works as they evolved. Alvaro Santana-Acuña, a sociologist at Whitman College who is working on a book about the history of “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” said the archive was already helping to explode some of the legends surrounding the novel, many of which were carefully crafted by García Márquez himself. The novelist, who won the Nobel Prize in 1982, had often spoken of the book as pouring out in a kind of magical trance. “I did not get up for 18 months,” he later said. But in fact, Mr. Santana-Acuña said, correspondence in the archive shows that he regularly sent out sections for reactions from friends and literary critics. He also published about a third of the chapters in newspapers around the world before the book’s publication, and sometimes made adjustments according to audience reaction, much as 19th-century writers like Charles Dickens would. “He published the most important chapters, to make sure he knew what different audiences — ordinary readers, literary critics, the intelligentsia — thought,” Mr. Santana-Acuña said. García Márquez, like many writers, claimed not to bother much with reviews, especially negative ones. But the archive includes a number of scrapbooks which carefully compile — and sometimes privately respond to — reviews of his work in many different languages. Mr. Santana-Acuña said he was particularly amused by a notation on a second review of “One Hundred Years of Solitude” that appeared in the conservative Colombia newspaper El Tiempo, which had initially dismissed the novel as badly written left-wing propaganda. “Al menos por larga y entusiasta!” García Márquez (who in the 1950s had written for a rival Colombian newspaper) wrote of the second effort — “At least it’s long and enthusiastic!”', 'author': 'Jennifer Schuessler', 'url': ['https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/arts/gabriel-garcia-marquez-archive-online.html'], 'tags': None, 'captions': ['Gabriel García Márquez with Fidel Castro in a photograph that will be available online as part of his archive.', 'A draft page from García Márquez’s novel “Chronicle of a Death Foretold” showing highlights and revisions.'], 'pubtime': datetime.datetime(2017, 12, 11, 0, 0), 'source': 'Nytimes_Arts'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Looking Again at a Painter Who Roamed Genres (Published 2004)', 'unique_id': 62993, 'para': 'He was a truly accomplished painter, into everything; his work ranged from post-Impressionism to the border of Abstract Expressionism. He could do straight Realism, Cézanne, Picasso, American Modernism, Surrealism, abstraction and -- involved with Socialist and Marxist politics -- drawings for the magazine New Masses. Whatever he did, his strong, vigorous hand produced an energetic image. But a consistent identity eluded the facile modernist Jan Matulka (1890-1972). Despite his talents, he never really established himself as a signature persona whose work was steeped in Matulka-ism, so to speak. Yet this Czech immigrant, who settled in the United States at the age of 17, by no means went unnoticed. Between 1916 and 1950 he turned out a prodigious body of paintings, drawings and prints; was a dedicated teacher at the Art Students League and elsewhere; and enjoyed the friendship of other modernists like Arshile Gorky, Stuart Davis, John Graham and David Smith, Matulka\\'s most famous student. When Abstract Expressionism came on the scene, he was no longer young, and his work sort of faded from the market, although in his isolation he concentrated on experimental abstractions. The retrospective \"Jan Matulka: The Global Modernist\" at the Montclair Art Museum in New Jersey comes 25 years after the first one, in 1979 at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Patterson Sims, now director of the Montclair museum, assembled this exhibition and helped organize the Whitney show. His goal in putting together this second version, with about 60 works, he says in the catalog, is not only to reach a new audience (many works on display were not available before), but also to raise questions about Matulka\\'s reception today. Foremost is whether the wide range of Matulka\\'s styles and subjects is \"less jarring and confounding\" than it seemed 25 years ago, Mr. Sims writes in the catalog. Does his art and career now look \"more credible and comprehensible\" given our current acclaim for artists who work in many styles and mediums? Perhaps a more pertinent question is how innovative was he in all his styles and mediums? A quick answer: not very. Still, at what he did for most of his career he was very good: an accomplished draftsman, a skilled colorist, adept at composition, whose sophisticated work melded solid European tradition with the elements of modernism. In short, a gifted painter who deserves a little more recognition in American art histories than merely as the teacher who encouraged David Smith. An early work here, \"Waterfall\" (1916), exemplifies the post-Impressionist style that Matulka learned at the conservative National Academy of Design in New York, where he studied from 1908 to 1917. But it represents a step forward. Its richly textured and loosely painted image of a tumultuous cascade may have been influenced by paintings that Marsden Hartley had done on this theme, dating from around 1910. Matulka soon left this mode for other adventures. After finishing at the academy, he visited the American Southwest, where in modified Cubist style he recorded, mostly in watercolor, the daily life and rituals of Southwest Indians. \"New Mexican Pueblo\" (1917) in the show is a lyrical arrangement of figural, plant and animal elements that fuse into a harmonious, ethnic fairy-tale whole. (He had a gift for fanciful illustrations; in 1919 and 1920 he illustrated two children\\'s books: \"Czechoslovak Fairy Tales\" and \"The Shoemaker\\'s Apron.\") Eager to see Europe again, particularly his home village in Czechoslovakia, Matulka made his first adult trip there in 1919 or early 1920. He spent six weeks in Paris, where he eventually established a studio and got to know figures like Gertrude Stein, and later touched down in Prague. In 1921 he and his wife summered in Czechoslovakia, looked in on the old family farm and rediscovered the primitive rural village of Turi Pole, which Matulka memorialized in many watercolors. One is \"Turi Pole Landscape\" (1921), a crisp, stylized view with trees, mountains, a brook and what appear to be thatched cottages. The work is all form, bringing style rather than emotion to this remote village. A crayon study, \"Three Slovak Peasants,\" done the same year, is also heavily stylized, depicting grim figures seated on their land, a skinny cow behind them. But it is far more expressive of the pain and isolation of rural existence. Alternating between Paris and New York in the early 1920\\'s, Matulka began to do precisionist-style city landscapes in 1924. These are among the best of his output, along with lyrical semiabstractions devoted to jazz and still life. Two of his New York City prints are on view; each titled \"Arrangement -- New York\" (1925), solid black-and-white massings of city buildings whose linearity is relieved by Art Deco-ish bursts of puffy smoke. But the most impressive is an oil, \"New York Harbor/Paris\" (1925), a compressed scene of busy boats against an aggressive backdrop of skyscrapers, a view of New York as the country\\'s powerhouse. Full of painterly rhythms that echo the city\\'s jazzy beat, it uses the tough glamour of Manhattan as a portent of American might. By 1932 Matulka had moved into an abstract mode of brightly colored biomorphic and geometric forms seen in works like \"Abstract Arrangement\" (1932), whose taut, interlocking bio- and geomorphic forms in brilliant colors made them vibrate on the canvas. He soon latched on to the Surrealist movement in New York and Paris, an affiliation that made a distinct impression on how he viewed the function of art. He saw that poetic inner impulses, laid bare by the pictorial devices of Surrealism, could be made accessible to the outer world. De Chirico, Dalí and others sparked his imagery, as seen in \"Surrealist Landscape\" (circa 1935), in which biomorphic but recognizable objects -- a saw, a clock, a seashell, a can opener, a large fork, a truncated tree trunk, a short flight of stairs and other objects -- disport on a sandy field against a background of beguiling blue sky. So much the better for their enigmatic juxtaposition; didn\\'t verbal poetry do the same? But Matulka was not at his best in Surrealist associations, and despite the movement\\'s influence on him, his work in this mode does not show him off to best advantage. Much better are his crisp, more realistic semiabstract works like \"Jazz Composition\" (1927), a terse rendition of a drummer\\'s trap set whose components have all the anima of figures, and \"Arrangement With Phonograph\" (1929), a brilliantly colored Picassoid still life that includes a large Oceanic mask, a banjo and a Victrola. Depressed by the Depression and other factors in his life, including the ending, in 1939, of his affiliation with the government-sponsored Federal Art Project, Matulka began to recede from art-world notice. His last one-man show of current work was at the A.C.A. Gallery in Manhattan in 1944. But his work has a vibrancy that will not let it go unseen. \"Jan Matulka: The Global Modernist\" is on view through Jan. 16 at the Montclair Art Museum, 3 South Mountain Avenue, Montclair, N.J., (973)746-5555.', 'author': 'Grace Glueck', 'url': ['https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/31/arts/design/looking-again-at-a-painter-who-roamed-genres.html'], 'tags': None, 'captions': None, 'pubtime': datetime.datetime(2004, 12, 31, 0, 0), 'source': 'Nytimes_Arts'}\n",
      "{'title': 'History’s Puppeteer: Wael Shawky at the Serpentine Gallery', 'unique_id': 132360, 'para': 'LONDON — There’s been quite a buzz around Wael Shawky lately. Since graduating with his MFA in 2001, the Egyptian artist has gone on to rack up an impressive number of accolades, including the Abraaj Capital and Schering Foundation prizes, while his canny contribution to last year’s Sharjah Biennial – a choral performance of a Qawwali song, the lyrics to which were fragments of curatorial text from the Biennial’s previous edition, translated into Urdu — earned him a share of the Biennial’s prize funds. Solo exhibitions have followed suit: over the last three years, Shawky has showcased his work at major European institutions, among them the forward-thinking Nottingham Contemporary and KW Institute for Contemporary Art , Berlin. Riding on this surge of enthusiasm, London’s Serpentine Gallery has deemed it time that Shawky receive his first major presentation in the capital, and the resulting exhibition is Wael Shawky: Al-Qurban (‘The Offering’) . Drawing on a wide range of media — among them digital animation, music, film and puppetry — Shawky probes a whole host of weighty, pertinent subjects, from Middle Eastern politics and religion to the impact of globalization and the power of storytelling. However, this practice makes his a particularly eloquent contribution to the Serpentine’s program, as an institution that has, under Hans-Ulrich Obrist’s direction, increasingly gone out of its way to encourage discourse on and with the Middle East, even hosting a two-day “learning camp” at Speakers’ Corner in September 2011 that focused on Cairo (and boldly titled ‘ I Love Egypt’, Speak out! ). Shawky’s current presentation is implicitly connected with this aspect of the Serpentine’s programming, having ostensibly evolved out of relationships cultivated during his 2011 residency with the Gallery’s offsite Centre for Possible Studies, the locus of its Middle Eastern community-oriented activities. Given its geopolitical leanings, you would be forgiven for suspecting that the Serpentine’s Shawky presentation might feel a little agenda-pushing. Happily the subtlety of Shawky’s work dispels such misgivings. The tone is set on entering the exhibition space: darkened for the purposes of screening the three films that make up the main body of Al-Qurban , the resulting murky light is evocative of the hazy and abstracted truths that Shawky is so interested in exploring. It’s this exploration that animates Shawky’s Cabaret Crusades (2010–2013): a four-part film series enacted with marionettes and scripts stitched together from various medieval sources, chronicling the Crusades from a non-Western perspective. Though both the first two films from the series are screened as part of the exhibition, it’s the marionettes from the second film, The Path to Cairo , which are first focused on. Spot-lit in a display case opposite the entrance stand three orderly rows of diminutive figures produced by Shawky with the assistance of professional ceramicists in Aubagne, France. Delightfully creepy, these men, women, and human-animal hybrids are realized in infinitesimal detail, their eyelashes, individual outfits and differing skin textures painstakingly rendered. Despite this verisimilitude, the display also calls attention to the “puppetness” of the figures, their strings stretched taut above their heads in a reminder that each body is just a cipher for the actions of their absent operators. The curators’ decision to begin the exhibition with these puppets is a shrewd one, since the abstraction that they represent — a stand-in for real people, their movements a copy of the original — serves as a key to Shawky’s work. The gap that is sensed between event and its representation when watching the trapdoor mouths of the Lupi collection marionettes jerkily open and close in deliberately unsynchronized speech in the first of Shawky’s Cabaret Crusades films, The Horror Show File (2010), recurs and widens in the second film of the series: realistic stage-sets give way to two-dimensional cityscapes with the appearance of children’s pop-up book illustrations, spoken idiomatic Arabic is superseded by a more arcane classical Arabic, speech dissolves into song, and the French heroic poem La Chanson de Roland is added to the mix of conflicting medieval source texts. As these self-conscious fissures in the narrative of the Crusades pile up, Shawky’s dissection of story-telling (history, in other words) grows more complete. This interest reaches an apex in Shawky’s new film, Al Araba Al Madfuna II (2013), which is receiving its world premiere at the Serpentine exhibition. Playfully credited as a “personal true story script based on tales,” the film eschews marionettes in favor of children dressed as adults (an approach Shawky used in his 2007 film Telematch Sadat ). These children relate to each other via two stories by the Egyptian author Mohamed Mostagab, both of which are about communities faced with challenging situations. Shot in monochrome against the dramatic ruins of El Araba El Madfuna, an ancient village in modern-day Abydos, the refracted narrative assumes a solemn, ritualistic quality that’s not felt elsewhere in the exhibition. As the children gather around a pool in still silence to commemorate their victory over a despotic ruler towards the film’s conclusion, it’s hard not to connect the unfolding narrative to current events in the region, and beyond that, the history that will inevitably subsume those events.

      "{'title': 'Lincoln Center’s President to Leave (Published 2012)', 'unique_id': 76718, 'para': 'Reynold Levy, the president of Lincoln Center who shepherded an ambitious redevelopment of its 16-acre campus during hard economic times, will step down at the end of next year. Mr. Levy, who assumed the post in 2002, informed the board on Thursday, explaining that he was leaving mainly because his work was done; the last piece of the center’s redevelopment project will be completed on Oct. 1, when the new pedestrian bridge spanning West 65th Street opens to the public. The move was announced on Monday afternoon. Lincoln Center’s trustees will use the bridge to pay tribute to him; it will be called the President’s Bridge: In Honor of Reynold Levy. Supporters say part of Mr. Levy’s legacy will be the collaborative spirit he built, using diligence and diplomacy, among the complex’s 11 historically contentious constituent groups, including the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera and New York City Ballet. “Reynold’s contribution cannot be overstated,” said Katherine G. Farley, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center . “He works harder than any human being I know. The way he fulfills the job is really grueling.” The center was able to raise $1.3 billion over the course of his tenure, much of it a result of a schedule that put him at work at 6:15 a.m. and regularly had him staying on till 11 p.m. for events. Nearly every weekday meal on those days was spent with a board member, colleague or prospective donor: sometimes he had two breakfasts in one day. And Mr. Levy has always made it a point to do his homework on people and to pay attention to details. He recalled in an interview one frigid winter morning, for example, when he took Raymond J. McGuire — a top Citibank executive and prospective Lincoln Center trustee — to breakfast. Mr. McGuire ordered sliced banana with his oatmeal, but the restaurant was out of bananas. So Mr. Levy excused himself, hustled out and came back with two bananas. Mr. McGuire joined the board. Mr. Levy, 67, said that his one solid plan for his future involved “beaches and books” — although he intends to some of those books as well as read them. (He has written one on the job: “Yours for the Asking: An Indispensable Guide to Fund-Raising and Management.”) “I will enjoy the freedom associated with a relatively unscheduled day,” he said. By all accounts, Mr. Levy has been a master schmoozer, though you wouldn’t know it to look at him; he doesn’t have the smooth salesmanship of a Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art, or the understated gravitas of a Frank A. Bennack Jr., Lincoln Center’s former chairman. Slightly stooped, with glasses and gray hair and often wearing a brown suit, Mr. Levy appears more like a rumpled professor than like the polished frontman for the country’s largest performing arts institution. He can wax lyrical about improvements to the central mechanical plant. This gentle, wonky first impression is disarming to many and belies a fierce passion for his cause and the capacity to close the deal. “He has an inner toughness,” said Blair W. Effron, a trustee. Mr. Levy is credited with developing new revenue streams for Lincoln Center that have helped create balanced or surplus budgets during his tenure, including rentals for New York Fashion Week, a new studio for Channel 13 , new restaurants, a publishing imprint and a new performing arts consulting business — with China as the first client. “We make as much money with new ventures as we made in ticket sales when he first got there,” Mr. Effron said. Mr. Levy said “changing the economic model at Lincoln Center” was essential today — “finding sources of recurring revenue that have nothing to do with ticket prices.” The campus’s physical transformation — designed by Diller Scofidio & Renfro — is visible. Alice Tully Hall has a new auditorium with translucent wood veneer walls and a restaurant that has just been taken over by the star chef Marcus Samuelsson (to open on Friday). The Film Society has a new home with two new theaters and a cafe. Lincoln Center Theater has a new experimental theater and a marquee. Lincoln Center has numerous new public spaces with free Wi-Fi, like the grandstand opposite Alice Tully, the updated fountain plaza and the sloped grass roof above the new restaurant, Lincoln. West 65th Street now contains the entrances to Lincoln Center Theater , the Film Society and the Juilliard School . And the nearby David Rubenstein Atrium has become like a Lincoln Center commons, attracting 750,000 people since it opened in 2009 with free performances, discount tickets and food by ’wichcraft. “There is a new vibe here, you can feel it,” Mr. Levy said. “You hang out and see thousands more people walking the campus.” Mr. Levy also pointed to recent programming choices that he said reflected well on the direction he has set, citing, among others, Cate Blanchett’s “Uncle Vanya,” Alan Cumming’s “Macbeth” and “The Clock” video installation at the Atrium, which drew 18,000 visitors. With a strong staff and board, Mr. Levy said he was leaving Lincoln Center in good hands. “I think,” he said, “it’s dangerous to conflate yourself with the institution.”', 'author': 'Robin Pogrebin', 'url': ['https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/25/arts/lincoln-centers-president-to-leave.html'], 'tags': None, 'captions': ['Reynold Levy.'], 'pubtime': datetime.datetime(2012, 9, 24, 0, 0), 'source': 'Nytimes_Arts'}\n",

      "{'title': 'From Craig Ferguson, a Novel Born of Literary Rambles (Published 2006)', 'unique_id': 47400, 'para': 'LOS ANGELES - Back in 2003, after he finished directing and starring in a movie he\\'d written, called \"I\\'ll Be There,\" Craig Ferguson sat down in his hotel room and began scribbling on a notepad. The experience of making the film, he says, had entailed so much meddling from the big studio that produced it and so many artistic compromises that Mr. Ferguson, who was not yet the host of \"The Late Late Show\" on CBS, felt the need to embark on a creative odyssey entirely within his control: he began to write a book. Those scraps of paper have yielded not a Hollywood tell-all, but a novel, \"Between the Bridge and the River,\" which is to be published by Chronicle Books on Monday. It is a sprawling, often allegorical tale that ranges from Mr. Ferguson\\'s native Scotland to Los Angeles, where he lives now, and includes a rambunctious, sometimes violent road trip through the American South. Its main characters include two old friends from Scotland, one of them a television evangelist whose program is derailed by a sex scandal; a femme fatale who has killed off six husbands; and a pair of half brothers sired by Frank Sinatra and Peter Lawford in their Rat Pack days. (\"Ring-a-ding-ding,\" Mr. Ferguson writes, appropriating one of Sinatra\\'s signature lines.) Among the other figures who make cameos, as Mr. Ferguson sends up Las Vegas and Hollywood, to say nothing of Christianity, Scientology, television news and the escort industry, are Carl Jung (wearing a Cossack\\'s uniform in one dream sequence), Larry King and Socrates. The book, which tops off at 329 pages, is filled with many surprises. Chief among them is probably this: unlike other television stars who have moonlighted as authors, including Jay Leno (the children\\'s book \"If Roast Beef Could Fly\" in 2004) and Drew Carey (\"Dirty Jokes and Beer: Stories of the Unrefined,\" in 1997) Mr. Ferguson has written a work of literary fiction, one that periodically tips its cap to Mikhail Bulgakov, Kurt Vonnegut, Joseph Campbell, Jung, Mark Twain and Herman Melville, among many others. In other words, it\\'s a book that may not necessarily sit well with many of the two million viewers who, on a typical night, stay up after David Letterman\\'s \"Late Show\" to hear Mr. Ferguson refer to them endearingly as \"cheeky wee monkeys\" or \"naughty little donkeys,\" as he aims barbs from his monologue at favorite targets like President Bush and Starbucks. It may also jolt those who know him best from his previous job, playing the officious boss, Mr. Wick, on Mr. Carey\\'s sitcom. \"This book could scare them,\" Mr. Ferguson said in a recent interview, at ease in sweatpants and a T-shirt behind the desk of his office here at CBS Television City. \"The sex, the violence, the dream sequences and the iconoclasm. I think a lot of people are uncomfortable with that. I understand that. It was very uncomfortable to write some of it.\" Which is not to say that Mr. Ferguson, 43, is unlikely to find an audience for his book. In a starred advance review in February, Publishers Weekly said that Mr. Ferguson had produced \"a tour de force of cynical humor and poignant reverie, a caustic yet ebullient picaresque that approaches the sacred by way of the profane.\" Even setting aside Mr. Ferguson\\'s career as a comedian and comic actor in Hollywood, his route to becoming a published author was a circuitous, unconventional one. He grew up outside Glasgow in a large family that cherished reading: his father, a postal worker, favored \"quasi-erotic, devil-worshipping spy novels,\" he said, and his mother preferred Lillian Beckwith, who wrote \"folksy and beautiful tales about the Outer Hebrides.\" His own early reading (\"Animal Farm,\" \"Lord of the Rings\") ground to a halt when he quit high school, at 16, \"mainly to drink.\" Mr. Ferguson never returned to the classroom, but he eventually began to design a syllabus of \"Great Books\" for himself to read, partly to plug the gaps in his education but also to ward off loneliness, particularly during long stretches on television and movie sets. His life as a reader has been, he says a \"meandering\" journey, in which a reference in one book to another book would send him running to the library. He recently read one of Mark Twain\\'s less famous works, a travelogue of the American West titled \"Roughing It,\" after learning of it from a mention in Jon Krakauer\\'s \"Under the Banner of Heaven.\" \"A friend of mine that I was in a band with started me on Kafka, which in turn led to Camus and Sartre,\" Mr. Ferguson said. \"And not long ago, maybe 10, 15 years ago, I did Gogol\\'s last play, \\'The Gamblers,\\' at the Tron Theater in Glasgow. That got me into the Russians, and from there I started reading Ostrovsky, then Dostoyevsky and eventually Bulgakov, \\'The Master and Margarita.\\' \" While \"Between the Bridge and the River\" includes homages, both veiled and overt, to works by those authors and others -- a chapter involving snake handlers mirrors a scene in \"Moby-Dick\" -- Mr. Ferguson has also imbued the story with anecdotes that, he said, happened to either him or his friends and relatives. \"This book is kind of \\'A Million Little Pieces\\' in reverse,\" he said. \"I\\'m claiming it\\'s a novel. I\\'m probably going to be outed in a while, when people find out a lot of this is true.\" Among the most painful passages in the book is a scene at the very outset, when one of the main characters, George, distracts a school-age bully from an attempt to molest a drunken friend, Fraser, who has passed out on a dirty canal bank. \"Willie bent over Fraser and started to unbuckle his belt,\" Mr. Ferguson writes. \"He was salivating, his face near the unconscious boy\\'s crotch. He yelled in agony and surprise as he felt George\\'s fishing rod strike the back of his neck like a cat-o\\'-nine tails.\" In the interview, Mr. Ferguson said: \"That is a fairly accurate accounting of what happened to me one day. I was Fraser, in that circumstance.\" Chronicle has given Mr. Ferguson\\'s book a first printing -- 30,000 copies -- that would be considered quite large for a first-time author who was not a Hollywood celebrity. But Mr. Ferguson said that far more important than the modest advance he received -- probably less than he would earn for a night of stand-up comedy -- was the freedom the publishing house gave him to tell his story with minimal editorial interference. He is already mapping out two sequels, one of which begins a half-hour after the first book ends, and another that centers on his femme fatale, Claudette, who ends \"Between the Bridge and the River\" pregnant by a lover who may or may not cheat death. And though he says he has had offers to make his debut novel into a movie, he says he won\\'t do it. \"It\\'s a book,\" Mr. Ferguson said. \"It\\'s mine.

      "{'title': 'Identities, Nations, and Histories Painfully Stitched Together', 'unique_id': 142328, 'para': 'NEW DELHI — Hybrid creatures in legends and myths speak to our collective imagination as a tool to perceive that which cannot be perceived or understood. These tricksters, transformers, shamans, and sorcerers construct a language of concealment and revelation, embodying dualistic forces. Reena Saini Kallat ’s series Hyphenated Lives speaks to these ideas and offers a point of entry into the artist’s personal exploration of the ways that identities are perceived and constructed. The series is part of a body of work first shown at Gallery Chemould in Mumbai and currently on view at Nature Morte in New Delhi. The exhibition, Porous Passages , covers 8 years of Saini Kallat’s practice, encompassing a wide range of media including drawing, photography, sculpture, video, and text-based installations. The Hyphenated Lives series includes mutated fauna and flora that manifest as creatures subverting their prescribed roles as icons of nationhood and state. These are not mere half-and-halfs, but include figures stitched together from endangered animals, emphasizing the inherent irony in upholding them as symbols while their populations dwindle due to man’s greed. In “Hyphenated lives (Ti-Khor)” (2015), the artist combines the Bengal tiger and the Markhor, a species of wild goat found in northeastern Afghanistan. The hyphen functions here both as constructed language and as paradoxical metaphor. In other works, Saini Kallat includes what look like anatomical drawings with notes and markings scribbled on the paper. The drawings and their presentation alongside a natural history museum-style display of documents, postcards, and fossil-like sculptures of unfired clay, allude to the many uses of remnants as objects. The work situates the viewer simultaneously in the past and present while these morphed futures shift our understanding of place, time, and geography — factors that are crucial in our constructions of social, historical, cultural, and political values. By suturing parts together with barbed wire, Saini Kallat acknowledges the implicit violence in the act of joining. In doing so, her work poses prickly questions: Do these creatures exist in order to emerge as something separate to fantasy or reiterate that we are living in one? Does their existence and our engagement with it lift the burdens of history and the apathy with which these lines were drawn by the colonizer? Is it disrupting the contemporary fascist from perpetuating mutated forms of the sociopolitical in our present and his posited futures for a people? The Hyphenated Lives series speaks to the way social values are constructed. Interpreting it as myth is one way of entering the work, but on closer inspection it is also rooted in a very precarious position, at once in perverse fantasy and in the present reality we passively consume daily. It is neither a fable nor an escape. Saini Kallat’s perversity is gentle, subtle, and transient, functioning in a different tenor from the erotic, polymorphous, and disorienting hybridity of Matthew Barney’s Cremaster Cycle , for instance. Saini Kallat’s perversity has its own complexities and they are visible, albeit in a restrained way, as a snide undercurrent in works like “ Synapse ” (2011). In this nine-minute video, 14 individuals attempt to read the letters on a Snellen chart at an ophthalmologist’s clinic. The chart, used to measure visual acuteness, is instead employed as a means to highlight our stubborn rootedness in particular notions of identity. What is being read out is a scrambled version of the Preamble of the Indian Constitution. “Synapse” speaks to perceptions, cognition, language, and the construction of freedom. It also highlights an internalized apathy toward recognizing our role in perpetuating corrupted state systems. Saini Kallat’s practice is a set of codes that re-work or shift the equilibrium of how we perceive and understand prevailing social and political orders. What distinguishes each body of work is the degree and depth of its subtle provocations. This is stronger in pieces like “Synapse” and “ Saline Notations (Echoes) ” (2015), as opposed to the palpable and familiar irony of her hybrid creatures. One could argue that there is by now a tendency for a literal interpretation of visual metaphors like those in the Hyphenated Lives series, given that ideas of identity and nationhood demand a different kind of reimagining. However, the gentle gesture of the ephemeral, where the waves of the ocean wipe away a monologue marked on the sand in salt, in “Saline Notations (Echoes),” is far more lucid and holds a power that goes straight to the point — lines, borders, and identities are solvent.

In his recital at Carnegie Hall on Monday evening, Mr. Goerne worked his magic quickly: within a bar or two, he sounded fully at home in a song, and he maintained an interpretive suppleness that kept his expressive moves fresh and unpredictable. With Christoph Eschenbach as his nimble and supportive pianist, Mr. Goerne divided his program between Schumann and Brahms, with the Schumann part devoted to settings of poetry by Heinrich Heine. In his opening group, Mr. Goerne capitalized on the fanciful imagery of “Abends am Strand,” “Es leuchtet meine Liebe” and “Mein Wagen rollet langsam,” using both his depth of tone and an agile approach to dynamics to animate all three. These songs, and the nine songs of “Liederkreis” (Op. 24), were offered as more than intimate salon readings. Mr. Goerne was not shy about singing at full power, at least at climactic points, and for him full power is of operatic proportions. His voice filled Carnegie easily and comfortably, but even in gentler, quieter moments, his diction remained remarkably clear and precise. After the intermission Mr. Goerne and Mr. Eschenbach collaborated on a fluid, gracefully drawn traversal of Brahms’s “Lieder und Gesänge” (Op. 32), and a sober and often haunting account of the “Four Serious Songs” (Op. 121). These settings from Ecclesiastes and Corinthians were the highlight of Mr. Goerne’s New York debut recital in 1996, and although it may be simply a matter of scale — the debut was at the Frick Collection’s 175-seat hall — his interpretation seems to have deepened notably. Back then his “Four Serious Songs” were powerful and appealing.

      "{'title': 'Does Our Age of Art World Boycotts and Museum Protests Prove That Resistance Is Not Futile?', 'unique_id': 224762, 'para': 'Does the first half of 2018 confirm that we are living in a new era of invigorated art world boycotts and museum protests? In March, photographer Nan Goldin’s activist group PAIN kicked off their series of protests against Purdue Pharmaceuticals and the particular Sackler family members who are Purdue’s majority owners, by leading an anti-opioids ‘die-in’ in the Metropolitan Museum’s Sackler Wing . The following month, cleaners employed by Ernst & Young took over the Tate Modern in London , using the investment firm’s sponsorship of a Picasso exhibition to draw attention to their precarious contracts. In May alone, Greenpeace activists installed a ‘fringe exhibition’ at the V&A to protest Volkswagen’s sponsorship of an exhibition about future technologies , and back in New York, activists led chants for ‘repatriation’ and ‘reparations’ at the Brooklyn Museum, calling out ‘collections obtained through imperial plunder.’       Calls to decolonize museum holdings organized (sometimes stolen) by wealthy white men have had their  moment this year. But caustic collisions over art, artifacts and cultural labour are nothing novel. One need only revisit the protests, performances and petitions organized by Art Workers Coalition (AWC: 1969–70), a group of artists who positioned themselves as cultural labourers confronting museum managers along a partially enacted, partially conceptual picket. The AWC demanded the creation of a social benefits programme for all artists, the institution of resale rights for artists’s work, the creation of permanent MoMA galleries dedicated to women and Latino artists, and free admission for all on evenings and the weekend (the last objective is the only one that actually stuck, though ironically it is branded today by the Japanese clothing chain UNIQLO). Lest we forget, it was Filippo Tommaso Marinetti who in his 1909 Manifesto called for Italian museums to be flooded by canals so as to make way for a new, futurist reality whose militaristic machismo seems perfectly at home in our own time of nationalistic crisis politics.  The revolutionary avant-garde project of merging art with life carries on apace in spite of the obvious absence of dadaists, productivists and futurists, (unless you believe as do I, that the current POTUS is himself a second-rate, manifesto-tweeting Marinetti redux). Instead this radical fusion is now made possible by the voracious appetite of neoliberal enterprise culture always in search of fresh markets, new brands and more clicks. Still, resistance is not futile. A ragtag cluster of international artists, curators, critics, and even some enlightened museum administrators, are pushing back. We can take the measure of this activism in a rash of recent books by Joanna Warsza, Yates McKee, Mel Evans , Kareem Estefan, Carin Kuoni, Laura Raicovich and Andrew Ross/Gulf Labor addressing the recent torrent of art world boycotts and museum interventions – from Istanbul, Brooklyn and São Paulo, to Sydney, Abu Dhabi and St. Petersburg.       Artist Mariam Ghani defines this new museum-focused art activism as ‘engagement through disengagement,’ by which she means that the artist boycott does not simply slam a door shut, but hammers out a new conduit for ongoing negotiations, a process she and I participated in as members of Gulf Labor Coalition with regard to defending the rights of mistreated migrant workers in the UAE sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi where another Frank Gehry Guggenheim is scheduled to be built. Likewise, theorists Kuba Szreder describes ‘productive withdrawal’ from institutions by cultural workers, and Yates McKee understands even the full-on ‘art strike’ not as the final curtain call between artist and museums, but as productive forces that prefigure new forms of communal organizing beyond the profoundly eroded antagonism separating public and private spheres. Curator Tirdad Zolghadr goes so far as to postulate that the art boycott ‘energizes, eroticizes, emotionalizes, mobilizes’ artists, and perhaps also the ‘ideological museum apparatus.’   Put differently, this is not our fathers’s or mothers’s, grandparents’s or distant fascist avant-garde ancestor’s art world conflict. For one thing, ‘art workers’ – the motivational premise of AWC – are now simply workers, or worse, they are unpaid interns and volunteers. Whatever privileged position the art labourer once held in a capitalist economy, whatever autonomy she or he claimed from market positioning, product branding, or from work itself, has been stripped away to reveal a bare art world in which the artist’s hyper-education does not save her from the precarious global army of surplus and redundant labourers capital no longer needs or pretends to serve. Academic and author Peter Fleming describes this situation as the ‘theatre of work,’ and anthropologist and anarchist activist David Graeber simply calls it ‘Bullshit Jobs’.       Likewise, museums are no longer the managers of consciousness as Hans Haacke once (correctly) observed in 1983. Even corporate sponsors seem to grasp this shift. Investing in art is not an ideological necessity when there is only one global financial system. Instead, owning and displaying cultural capital is an end in itself, regardless of whether the work is a glittering balloon dog one week and an emaciated stick-figure sculpture the next. From Jeff Koons’s glamour to Alberto Giacometti’s existential angst, museum programming is like affect-surfing between content streams on HBO, Amazon Prime, and Netflix. In an age of information-overload and continuous self-promotion, museums get to skip-over Cold War-era platitudes about art’s deep humanist value and service to individual freedom, in order to provide spectators with a uniquely embodied experience of luxury that is conspicuously linked with the world’s one percent. Does anyone blink an eye?  Mercifully, some renegade cultural institutions – The Reina Sofía in Spain, Van Abbemuseum in The Netherlands, The Queens Museum in the US, Metelkova in Slovenia, the Museum of Science and Art (MUCA) in Mexico among others, as well as many smaller, cooperative spaces, micro-institutions and informal collectives – strive to opt-out of, or at least distance themselves from naked market conditions. They serve as conduits for an informally organized ressentiment whose vibrant dark matter agency condenses within our bare art cosmos like fog hitting cold night air. Among these particulates of resistance is the Consortium for Postartistic Practices, a renegade cadre of Polish artists adopting the acronym of the former Communist Party (CCP) in order to instantiate imaginative practices outside monetized channels of mainstream, art market culture. There is also the Hackfeminist collective Laboratorio de Interconectividades in Mexico who practise digital self defence and preach open source technology sharing in a reboot of 1990s Tactical Media Art. Or consider ‘The Unbribables’ in Serbia who launched a prohibited media campaign decrying institutional surrender to corporate privatization by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Belgrade (MSUB), and were immediately arrested for wearing mocking masks of authoritarian president Aleksandar Vučić. The museum’s director later told the press ‘that such kinds of art, exceeds certain limits of civilized norms.’       Nonetheless, the intransience of these cultural outliers – both dissident museums and dark matter art activists – is typically rewarded with elevated levels of uncertainty and instability from both within and without. The revolution may be digitized, but it certainly is no dinner party. Which is why Warsza reflects in her book I Can’t Work Like This (2017) that, ‘maybe boycotts are, for now, an attempt to move on in art, without a better way of doing so …’ and it is precisely this state of speculative unknowing that may prove to be the most productive aspect when art worlds collide.

      "{'title': 'When Great Art Makes You LOL', 'unique_id': 134363, 'para': 'If you heard peals of laughter ringing out through the quiet, reverent halls of an art museum, what would your reaction be? Would you “tut-tut” in their general direction, maybe shoot them a glare or offer them a pointed “shhh”? If so, can we be totally sure that you, and not they, are in the right? For contemporary artists who love to insert a little bit of humor in their work, the situation above begs the question:  Can art be funny? Yes, of course — but it doesn’t have to be, whereas comedy has to be funny or else it fails. The basic structure of a joke is simple: set-up, punchline, laugh, repeat. No laughs is proof that the joke doesn’t work. But art? It can be whatever it wants to be, as long as it’s full of thoughts, emotions, humanity, concepts, etc. Melissa Rocha is a stand-up comedian who also hosts The TV Show Show , a themed comedy variety show. (Full disclosure: Alicia Eler participated in the Seinfeld edition .) Rocha left her performance art career behind when she realized she was funny, and wanted to work on crafting jokes. We caught up by phone about her transition, and why it happened. “The part of comedy that most artists and people have a hard time with is the failure of it,” she said. “It is so brutal…the trial and error is a lot harder to get a grip on. In the art world, you can just explain it.” Another defining difference between art and comedy is that the latter has a clear purpose: the goal is to land the joke. It’s a comforting, binary relationship: either you’re funny, or you’re not. In art, there is no clear goal — there is no end, and there may not be a beginning, either. The complete lack of rules — of form and structure — can be overwhelming. But artists, unlike comedians, also have a convenient out if their funny art isn’t really funny. When art is , it’s a bonus — but it doesn’t have to be to succeed. “It’s about safety, ” said Rocha . “It’s like, ‘I’m an artist, and if you don’t think it’s funny that’s okay because it’s art.’ But if you do stand-up, improv, and sketch comedy that is specifically, deftly 100% supposed to be funny, and if it’s not, then you have no safety.” But is funny art actually funny? The answer, as we see it, is a rousing chorus of “it depends.” Of course, to just use the term “art” when talking about this is to be imprecise. There are many different kinds of art — painting, sculpture, performance, whatever bullshit Richard Prince is currently up to — and they each come with their strengths and limitations. For the purposes of this essay, we are going to break these forms down into two separate categories: static and temporal. The former, like painting and sculpture, produces pieces that are fixed and immutable. The latter, like performance and video pieces, exists in multiple, successive moments in time. For the most part, temporal art can incorporate and commingle with comedy fairly well, whereas static art (again, for the most part ) does not. Now, don’t get us wrong here: an image can of course be funny. For proof, check the internet. In 2016, we used funny memes as a kind of relational currency: I will gladly be friends with you tomorrow for a crying Jordan meme today. However, static art that attempts to be funny rarely succeeds at being both funny and art at the same time. This is inherent to its nature. In order to be funny, the artwork has to both set up the joke and deliver the punchline in one go. In order to do this, the art often has to sacrifice depth. Because here’s the thing about comedy: it relies on the subverting of expectations, which means that it cannot exist without them. Jokes need to be clear and comprehensible, but ones  that are too easily understood — where the punchline can be seen coming from a mile away — are often the least funny jokes of all. These are the types of amateur jokes that you’re likely to hear during an attempt to write a funny wedding speech . But if you take any basic piece of comedy — “ Why did the chicken cross the road?” , “Knock knock? Who’s there?” , “Take my wife! Please!” — you will see that it follows that structure of expectation and subversion. The more surprising the subversion, the funnier the joke. Static art often lacks this element of surprise, because in order for its joke to be understood, it has to sacrifice most everything else. Yes, Marcel Duchamp was able to blow everyone’s mind when he took a toilet, called it a fountain, and declared it to be art — but he also had the benefit of novelty. When you’re the first person to do something, you get a lot of credit, as you should. Once we move past Duchamp to the works that he influenced, the flood of ingenuity becomes a trickle in no time. Because, while a funny piece of static art can maybe make you laugh, is it going to make you ponder it? Or feel much? Or even think about it again, once your momentary guffaw has passed? Likely, it will not. (Again, Duchamp is granted a special waiver here for innovation.) What is great about art — and is especially true about great art — is how it moves beyond the “get it/don’t get it” binary and gets at something far deeper, more complex and unsettled. Nobody stares at a Monet to “understand” the waterlilies. An example of jokey static art is Eric Yahnker’s , who creates visual puns oftentimes in the form of title-as-punchline, or by just meme-ifying an image. In many ways, Yahnker is a political cartoonist; it’s not surprising that his training is actually in journalism, and he worked on the cartoon South Park. B ut with the death of the political cartoonist job and the rise of the internet, he decided to create his own small business as an artist, which ultimately gives him the freedom to do whatever he wants. Take, for example, his “American Piece,” a collection of VHS tapes lined up one by one on a shelf that all have “American” in the title. The humor is dry, almost kicking up dust. And, naturally, the name of his recent solo show in LA was Noah’s Yacht , a play on the biblical story of Noah’s Ark. Similar, humor-wise, is Cory Arcangel, whose dry wit comes across in his work “Super Mario Clouds” (2002), which is literally just the clouds of this game. It is a versatile piece, working as a tongue-in-cheek trick — haha, it’s just the clouds screengrabbed as a single image! — or the six-minute video of the clouds , decontextualized from their video game environment, existing as, well, pixelated clouds. Temporal art forms still have an easier time escaping the basic  “get it/don’t get it” binary, and more gracefully collaborate with comedic forms. Because the art unfolds through time, it can create multiple sets of expectations and multiple forms of subversion. It can be funny in one moment and then deadly serious the next. It can play with multiple ideas — or at the very least many unique shades and tones within the same thematic palate. For instance, Jason Musson, aka Hennessy Youngman, is hilarious. His ArtThoughtz videos are basically vlogs, and work in part because they’re performed by his alter ego — not by him, the Artist. He takes on the persona of a vlogger dude who breaks down theory concepts, like post-structuralism, into something easily consumed on the internet. The mission of Musson’s Youngman character is to take art less seriously by bringing in some humor. Writes Don Elder for Hyperallergic: Part of Musson’s success with Art Thoughtz has been the creation of an unlikely character that challenges the core of the intellectual orthodoxy of today’s art world. Hennessy Youngman introduces a comedic, urban perspective into a largely serious and boring Ivy League discourse (a slightly ironic gesture, since Musson has an MFA degree from UPenn). Yeah, that’s real. Andrea Fraser similarly uses comedy to a critical effect in her performance “ Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk”  (1989) , where she played the fictional character Jane Castleton, a docent/volunteer/artist who took people around the Philadelphia Museum of Art, commenting on toilets, the shop, the coat room, and other things that were not pieces of art, while also inserting her own social and political commentary. Using docent-speak, she blurred a fictional and “real” experience of the art museum. A number of artists who are exploring with comedy create personas.  Erin Markey ’s queer, feminist comedy and live performances make us laugh hard because, as she once put it , they’re “absurdist and sometimes dark.” Some call her an actress, while others refer to her as a comedian or performance artist. Her intense cabaret–style rendition of Taylor Swift’s “You Belong With Me” transforms a song that’s marketed as sugar-sweet pop. Between Markey’s lecherous gaze as she performs  and the ways that she over-enunciates every word, audiences are left wondering how they could’ve just hummed along to this actually dark song. Is it performance art, comedy, or both? Similarly, Dynasty Handbag , aka Jibz Cameron, plays with the absurd alter-ego, creating a buffer between real-life and fictional comedic performance. Dynasty is so over-the-top — we are fascinated like we are with a John Waters film — so we’ll go with her anywhere . Her performance work is actually funny — not just poking fun at the art world — and at times she ends up on bills and slates that include comedians. In her recent music video “Vague,” a spoof on Madonna’s “Vogue,” Dynasty dances and wanders amidst a variety of odd backdrops while also pulling off signature vogueing moves. Except for her, everything is vague — she’s not sure where she is or what’s going on, and most of what she says is almost incomprehensible. At one point, she sings about a vague situation she may have been in, where she couldn’t tell if it was a business lunch or a date. Produced by the comedy network JASH, Dynasty’s work fits into both the art and comedy worlds, creating something else entirely. Her work embraces a kind of middle space, a queering of traditional boundaries — expressing a kind of nihilism where maybe everything matters, maybe nothing matters, but either way, LOL. This lack of an agenda — of “say a joke, get some laughs, repeat” — is crucial to Dynasty’s work coexisting as both “art” and “comedy.” It’s clearly funny, but that isn’t all it is. It’s also significant that her videos are being presented by a comedy network. And it’s not just the artists who are breaking into the comedy scene — many comedians are taking their cues from the more contemplative, multi-shaded aspects of art. Though this is not new, either. It just seems like it is, because the accessibility to artists that is afforded to us by the internet can make us feel inundated with content. Ernie Kovacs, for example, was bringing his own brand of cigar-chomping weirdness to network TV in the 1950s. Then there was, of course, the sublimely British Monty Python , and the formalist silliness of early Steve Martin. (In fact, Martin himself has admitted that parts of his standup act were specifically designed to eschew punchlines entirely.) In the ’80s and ’90s Bill Hicks tested the stand-up comedy form to see just how much deeply felt philosophizing it could include. And then of course there was Andy Kaufman, who pushed stand-up so far that many declared that he just flat-out wasn’t funny . Comedians have been testing the limits of the form — and of their audiences — for decades. Some of the best modern examples of comedy-acting-like-art come from Cartoon Network’s late night Adult Swim block. That’s right, just in time for you to have forgotten it, we’re dragging Too Many Cooks back into your nightmares. Tim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job may have been the first Adult Swim show that blended comedy and art, usually using copious amounts of horror and weirdness as bonding agents, but it certainly wasn’t the last. And while Too Many Cooks was the video that really went viral, the far weirder, far scarier Unedited Footage of a Bear provides an even better example of comedy becoming art. The film begins with a simple premise: it’s a commercial for an allergy medicine with a suspiciously long list of possible side effects. It’s a joke that’s been done before, but never like this: as a horror movie portrait of a psychotic breakdown. So is Unedited Footage of A Bear comedy, art, or both? Well, the film was directed by Alan Resnick and Ben O’Brien, who both belong to the Baltimore-based art and performance Collective Wham City. Maybe the real question is, does the distinction between comedy and art even matter? In reality, many comedians would bristle at being told that they are not artists. And maybe they should. After all, they are expressing their own thoughts and views through the creation of original work — just like other artists do.  And while some comedians can be easily lumped into the category of crass, mass-market entertainers (see: Kevin James ), the exact same could be said of some artists. Ultimately, if there is one thing that artists and comedians share is their impulse to express something that is true about the world or themselves. As the old standard goes, “it’s funny because it’s true.” Replace the word funny with the word “touching” or “important” or “revelatory” and the same sentence could be applied to any great work of art. Art can definitely be funny and still be art. More importantly, it can still be great art. The only difference is in the labelling and in the expectations that those labels can create. Label something as “art” and people might not expect to laugh, but label something as “comedy” and they will.

      "{'title': 'Belgian Artist Jan Fabre Forced to Quit Directorship of Greek Festival After Protests', 'unique_id': 245866, 'para': 'Belgian artist Jan Fabre resigned this past Saturday, April 2, from his role as artistic director of the Greek summer arts event, the International Festival of Athens and Epidaurus, Reuters reports. This might be one of the shortest tenures of a festival director ever recorded, as only one month earlier Fabre was invited by the Greek Ministry of Culture to curate the festival’s 2016-2019 editions. His resignation follows a vociferous protest from locals in response to his announcement that the programming for this summer’s edition would be dedicated to his native Belgium. “In 1980 the ‘Flemish Wave’ was born when a group of interdisciplinary artists overturned artistic conventions and influenced the art scene to become what it is today,” Fabre explained at the press conference in Athens on March 29 . Furthermore, the ensuing editions were to focus on artists who have collaborated with Fabre. According to this concept, Greek artists would have made up one third of the lineup. This outraged Greek performing artists and members of parties across the political spectrum, who would have been financially impacted by Fabre’s focus on Belgian artists. Subject to drastic budget cuts, local performers and artists penned an open letter on April 1 demanding the resignation of both Fabre and the Greek minister of culture, Aristides Baltas. “First we do not recognize you as the artistic director of the Festival of Athens and Epidaurus, and second, we need you to repair the insult that you have made \\u200b\\u200bby doing what makes sense: send your resignation to the minister who gave it to you,” the letter reads. Fabre stepped down the following day, explaining that he had accepted the invitation to direct the festival under the condition of artistic freedom. “This is not possible any more in Greece. I do not want to work in a hostile artistic environment in which I came with an open mind and heart,” Fabre wrote in a press release announcing his resignation. This past Monday, the culture ministry announced Fabre would be replaced by the Greek actor-turned-director Vangelis Theodoropoulos. However, the minister of culture expressed his bitterness at what he perceives as a missed opportunity “aimed not only to extend the international character of the Festival but also to make Greek creations known internationally.” The festival has been running for over six decades and has featured iconic figures from Maria Callas to Dame Margot Fonteyn, while spotlighting performances of ancient Greek drama. The festival runs from June to the end of August and is held mainly in Athens, and the ancient theater of Epidaurus in the Peloponnese.

      "{'title': \"Boris Eifman: Russia's maverick choreographer (Published 2007)\", 'unique_id': 68807, 'para': 'Soviet-era film clip of a rehearsal of the Leningrad Ballet Ensemble shows the choreographer Boris Eifman at work on a duet for his 1987 ballet, \"The Master and Margarita.\" Dressed in black, his intense face framed by a shock of black curls and a dark beard, Eifman hovers over his two dancers, instructing and explaining with evident passion. \"I would like some heavier poses,\" he says, dramatically bending his neck to one side to demonstrate. This month in Midtown Manhattan Eifman again stood with his back to studio mirrors, rehearsing his dancers in one of the four ballets that the 45-member Eifman Ballet of St. Petersburg is performing during its two-and-a-half-week engagement at City Center, which opened on Friday. His distinctive locks and beard were gray, his body a bit stouter and less nimble. But his zeal was unmistakably the same. Dramatic movements and clear-cut poses have always been hallmarks of Eifman\\'s company, which celebrates its 30th anniversary this year. Theatrical glitter has been another constant: extravagant sets and costumes and an often spectacular use of lighting and stage effects. Eifman has also typically chosen tragic psychological narratives for his ballets, from tales of heroes and heroines trapped in asylums (\"Red Giselle,\" \"Don Quixote,\" \"The Master and Margarita\") to sagas of characters crushed by their societies (\"Anna Karenina,\" \"Tchaikovsky,\" \"Russian Hamlet\"). And from the beginning his work has split audiences and critics into galvanized camps, those who adore his ballets and those who avoid them. The Siberian-born Eifman, a promising graduate of the Leningrad Conservatory, was appointed director of the little-known Leningrad Ballet Ensemble at 30, in 1977. And if much has remained constant over the last three decades, much has also changed. \"The life of my company can really be divided into three decades,\" Eifman said recently through an interpreter, \"the Soviet period, the perestroika era and the last 10 years.\" The timing of his career, Eifman acknowledged, had played a crucial part in his success. Unlike his mentor, the experimental choreographer Leonid Jakobson, Eifman came along when the regime\\'s cultural restrictions were beginning to loosen. \"It\\'s my huge luck that I was born 40 years later than Jakobson,\" he said. \"Because Jakobson only fought. But I had the opportunity not only to fight but to win.\" Yet in 1977 Eifman\\'s prospects didn\\'t look much brighter than Jakobson\\'s had. Eifman managed to secure his own small Leningrad ballet company. But even before its first performance he found himself battling cultural bureaucrats over his choice of music for one dance on the program: Pink Floyd. Eifman threatened to cancel his sold-out concert if he couldn\\'t perform the piece. Half an hour before curtain he received permission to do it - once. Political gamesmanship demanded much of Eifman\\'s energy in his company\\'s first decade. But he persisted in pursuing controversial subjects. Not surprisingly cultural authorities often called him into their offices. \"They said that it would be best if I left, and that, as at that time Jews were being allowed to emigrate to the United States, they were ready to let me go at any moment,\" Eifman said. Instead he stayed and built his company, serving as the troupe\\'s sole choreographer, as well as administrator, teacher, recruiter, marketer and government liaison. By 1986, doubting that he could go on much longer, Eifman decided to create the ballet he assumed would destroy his theater, \"The Master and Margarita.\" \"I staged a very sincere ballet,\" he said. \"I showed the mental institution where the dissident is taken to have his thoughts suppressed. And there was no question in my mind, after that I wouldn\\'t be allowed to continue working.\" Yet the moment that he finished it, in 1987, perestroika was taking root. \"When I showed my ballet to the commission,\" Eifman recalled, \"the panel said, \\'Oh, it\\'s a work of art of the new Russia.\\' \" He added, \"Overnight I went from dissident to people\\'s hero.\" That success ushered in a period of transformation that lasted through 1997. For the first time Eifman was able to create ballets freely. In 1988 the state granted the company its own rehearsal space, and state financing remained stable even after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. A new generation of dancers arrived, and with them the Eifman style was forged. It was bold, psychological and highly theatrical, and its off-kilter classical movement was performed by expressive actor-dancers who transmitted what he called \"a new kind of emotional energy\" onstage. A phone call from the arts promoter Sergei Danilian in 1996 heralded a third era. The company had already been touring in Europe; now Danilian proposed to introduce Eifman to the U.S. market. In 1998 the company began what would become a regular tour of U.S. cities. The third decade, Eifman stressed, has brought its own pressures. Despite receiving more substantial state financing than in the past, the company maintains a heavy foreign touring schedule, to subsidize his lavish productions and to supplement his artists\\' salaries. And he remains heavily involved with administrative duties, including the creation of two major new projects: a dance academy planned for 2009 and a home theater for the company, its first, to be built by 2012 as part of a major redevelopment project in St. Petersburg. But most daunting is the responsibility of creating new ballets. To celebrate the company\\'s 30th anniversary Eifman decided to risk a Chekhov adaptation. His new ballet, \"The Seagull,\" with Chekhov\\'s two clashing writers transformed into choreographers, will have its New York premiere on Wednesday. \"I put so much of who I am in this work, of my life in theater for the last 30 years,\" he said. When he was starting out, he added, he was like the young writer Konstantin Treplev in Chekhov\\'s play. \"I rebelled against the successful art of the Bolshoi and the Kirov, and I thought it was all up to me to bring new ideas and new forms that could move the art forward.\" In the last few years, Eifman noted, he had instead begun to identify with the play\\'s older writer, Boris Trigorin. \"Because for me,\" Eifman said, \"Trigorin is not somebody who rested on his laurels but a person who\\'s still a seeker. He\\'s still looking for innovative forms of expression.\"', 'author': None, 'url': ['https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/16/arts/16iht-goodwin.1.5302998.html'], 'tags': None, 'captions': None, 'pubtime': datetime.datetime(2007, 4, 16, 0, 0), 'source': 'Nytimes_Arts'}\n",

From her native land, Sardinia, Lai had an unimpeded view toward a horizon as vast as the sea, though as an islander, she knows that that not only is space infinite, it can also be a wall. And she courageously crossed over it, in the early 1940s, to move to Venice as a young woman to study with the sculptor Arturo Martini. The influence of sculpture is evident in the solid construction of the figures in her drawings and paintings from the 1960s, and also in her facility for manipulating different materials, such as cement, clay, and even bread. Pandemonio (Pandemonium), 1977, depicts a ferocious demon, made of bread, with which she debunks the concept of a patriarchal god by domesticating it. The artist inherited the archaic force of legends and popular traditions from her upbringing, which she recounts in performances such as Legarsi alla Montagna (To Tie Oneself to the Mountain), 1981, a collective action of epic proportions documented here in the video Legare collegare (To Tie and Connect), 1981, where the artist translates archetypes into an essential language, tying together the inhabitants, the houses, and the mountain of her native village, Ulassai, with more than sixteen miles of light-blue denim ribbons. For Lai, art is the desire for the impossible, and it belongs to everyone. If she uses humble materials such as thread and fabric and equipment such as a loom, it is because she grasps what life has to offer, without hierarchies, in an adaptable fashion yet within a rigorous discipline. In her fabric books, including Libro cucito (Sewn Book), 1996, writing and drawing are the same thing: The artist skillfully designs mysterious short poems using a sewing machine, according to an internal rhythm that extends over the soft pages, that then become curled in a tangle of threads, where all the stories of the world converge.

      "{'title': 'Flying Blind: de Kooning’s “Closed-Eye” Drawings', 'unique_id': 143425, 'para': 'There are 24 charcoal drawings now on display at the Museum of Modern Art that Willem de Kooning did with his eyes closed. This was not an uncommon thing for de Kooning, who often liked to close his eyes, or avert his eyes, or use them to watch TV while he drew. This may sound like a gimmick, or some kind of dada or surrealist gambit, or an act of desperation from an artist running on fumes. But it was none of these. In a fascinating, in-depth study called “’With Closed Eyes’: De Kooning’s Twist” (published in Master Drawings , vol. 40, no. 1, Spring 2002), the art historian Richard Shiff argues that de Kooning’s closed-eye technique: … allow[ed] de Kooning to circumvent what was for him the more intellectual and regulative organ, the eye, lest it inhibit the more physical organ, the hand. Shiff’s description of de Kooning’s splitting of sight and touch, intellection and spontaneity brought to mind Allan Kaprow’s influential essay “The Legacy of Jackson Pollock,” (1958) in which Kaprow treats Pollock as a precursor to Performance Art: We saw in his example the possibility of an astounding freshness, a sort of ecstatic blindness. … With the huge canvas placed upon the floor, thus making it difficult for the artist to see the whole or any extension of “parts,” Pollock could truthfully say he was “in” his work. Here the direct application of an automatic approach to the act makes it clear that not only is this not the old craft of painting, but it is perhaps bordering on ritual itself, which happens to use paint as one of its materials. Compare this with what Shiff says about de Kooning: Those close to him during the 1960s report that he appeared to feel visual form within himself, stretching and bending in imitative ways while either observing a figure or making a rendering. Even in the way they used their bodies in their art, de Kooning and Pollock remain the yin and yang of painting in their time, with Pollock as outwardly directed, placing himself in the center of the action while flinging skeins of paint all around him, and with de Kooning as inwardly directed, feeling his forms inside his body and pushing them out through the more conventional means of paintbrushes and charcoal sticks. But with both artists we encounter the implication of blindness. Kaprow notes that the scale of the canvas on the floor made it “difficult for the artist to see the whole or any extension of ‘parts,’” and he terms Pollock’s act of painting “a sort of ecstatic blindness.” Shiff quotes an often-cited statement that de Kooning wrote for a book published in 1967 comprising the same suite of 24 untitled 8 x 10-inch drawings now at MoMA: I am the source of a rumor concerning these drawings, and it is true that I made them with closed eyes. Also the pad I used was always held horizontally. The drawings often started by the feet … but more often by the center of the body, in the middle of the page. There is nothing special about this … but I found that closing the eyes was very helpful to me. This is fairly matter-of-fact, and, frankly, not very useful. But Shiff offers another quotation that gets a little deeper into the matter: A model can take many different poses, but the only thing that counts is how the hand sets her on the paper. How she lives on the paper. I draw while she lives on the paper. De Kooning’s hand, then, feels out the image in two dimensions, creating space and volume that exists in its own enclosed precinct. I speculate that the sensation would not be far removed from the way he squeezed clay between his fingers to make his gangly, clotted sculptures, which were always one or two steps removed from being bas-reliefs. These drawings would be marvelous by any standard; that they were done blindly is astonishing. The sensitivity of touch, the rawness of the sexuality, the tactility of the forms, the wit and invention of the imagery, and the ethereal gradations of the charcoal line are masterful even by de Kooning’s very high bar. Unlike many of the artist’s works on paper, the closed-eye drawings are not heavily revised — the anxiety engendered by “the more intellectual and regulative organ, the eye,” does not enter the picture. They are as economical in their free-floating lyricism as anything the artist ever made, including his problematic last paintings, which some would contend were handicapped not by closed eyes but by cognitive impairments. The drawings’ relative simplicity reveals a more basic de Kooning, one that allows his impulses to transition from imagination to representation unimpeded. The dominant themes — male and female nudes and crucified men — afford a more straightforward portal into de Kooning’s Eros/Thanatos conflict than his paintings, where the force of the brushwork and the dazzle of the color can lead the mind in dozens of different directions. This view of de Kooning also more readily gives up his sources, with successive drawings conjuring up a parade of Northern European masters from Bosch and Rubens to Ensor and Nolde to Dix and Kokoschka. You would think that drawing without the usual dialogue between eye and hand would result in repetitiveness, the same marks wandering over the page in insignificant variations. But the 24 drawings include figures grappling with each other, or cavorting in party dresses, or hefting themselves on chin-up bars, or nude and spread-eagled, or nude and nailed to a cross. The lines are dense or wispy, the charcoal applied in pearlescent gradations or explosive flecks and hatches. As de Kooning wrote in his 1967 statement, the drawings were done horizontally, but they are displayed vertically. One piece reveals its latitudinal origins: it depicts a woman who appears to be hanging off another, but if the sheet were turned on its side, it would be evident that she’s bending over the second woman, who is lying on a divan or bed. We accept this breach of pictorial logic, however, because the image so fully “lives on the paper.” Not just the image, but the artist as well. Shiff points out the equivalence that de Kooning drew between life and art, between the body and the act of making: Identifying physically with his art, de Kooning made little distinction between configuration in a drawing and in himself: rendering a model with eyes closed, “you think about your [own] eyes, your ears, your nose and mouth.” This kind of substitution or “slippage” corresponds to the linguistic trope of metonymy, as when we say of a mere picture, “This is me,” only to mean, “there is my image” … Given de Kooning’s practices, one is all the more inclined to take his metonymic assertions as literal fact. The power of these drawings and, for that matter, MoMA’s epic de Kooning retrospective last year, is commensurate with the amount of skin he put into the game. The suite of 24 untitled drawings by Willem de Kooning is part of  Eyes Closed/Eyes Open: Recent Acquisitions in Drawings , which also features work by Franz Erhard Walther and Martha Rosler.

The material is primarily used in Trachtenkleidung , a type of traditional Austrian clothing that is often produced in olive green and gray-brown. Originally intended to protect against inclement weather, today Trachtenkleidung clothing has become a symbol of conservative values such as a nativist devotion to one’s homeland. What happens, then, when the shape and color of the loden garment are altered? For his 2010 project BURNING LOVE (Lodenfüßler) , the Swiss artist Christian Philipp Müller had a nearly 160-foot-long strip of white loden created in Styria. The swath was outfitted with twenty circular openings, and for the performance component of the project, twenty men slipped into this oversize raincoat and hiked through the Styrian countryside. The procession, which resembled a mass gay wedding, suggested, among other things, the homoerotics of masculinist patriotism. The video of the men’s absurd yet somehow sacred perambulations is on view in this excellent exhibition. Nearby, a red loden cloak is draped over a sheep’s pen, and a white robe hangs over a feeding trough. Instead of recalling the overwrought connection to homeland, here the material brings to mind the apparel one would see in a circus, church, or some kind of protection ceremony. In addition, Müller exhibits photographs that depict him walking through the streets of New York and Miami dressed in the red and white loden cloaks. This immediately evokes the Ku Klux Klan; again, the cut and color of the garments in unexpected contexts displaces the objects’ meaning, yielding more associations than just Austrian nationalism.

      "{'title': 'The Gray Market: Why California Voters Just Dealt an Election-Day Loss to the Entire Art World (and Other Insights)', 'unique_id': 252003, 'para': 'Every Monday morning, Artnet News brings you The Gray Market . The column decodes important stories from the previous week—and offers unparalleled insight into the inner workings of the art industry in the process. This week, sounding the alarm on a quiet but devastating election outcome…  On Tuesday, while much of the world frantically refreshed browser tabs and social-media feeds for updates on the US presidential election, California voters approved a ballot measure that effectively handed Silicon Valley the power to write its own labor regulations for its ride-share and delivery drivers throughout the state. The outcome doesn’t just signal deep trouble for Golden State artists and arts workers who turn to the gig economy to supplement often-volatile compensation. It also tolls an ominous bell for their counterparts across the United States, and for the art industry as a whole. Known as Proposition 22, the measure sought to counteract a 2018 California Supreme Court ruling and 2019 state legislation that would have required Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, and others to classify their drivers as employees entitled to minimum-wage guarantees, health insurance, and other benefits. The companies portrayed these shifts in labor law as damaging to all sides of the transactions their apps enable, arguing that the regulations would strip drivers of the flexibility that many cite as the greatest advantage of gig work, raise prices and lengthen wait times for customers, and plunge Silicon Valley into an expensive and unnecessary compliance labyrinth. Instead, Prop 22 asked California voters to give Big Tech the ability to define its drivers (or, as Uber prefers to call them, its “driver partners”) as independent contractors only deserving what I would call a liquid-diet version of labor protections. The Los Angeles Times editorial board summarized the meager benefits that Prop 22 would usher in as follows: “a wage floor that translates into about 20 percent less than the state minimum ” (a calculation Uber and Lyft dispute), “insurance that covers [drivers] to some degree in the case of on-the-job injury or death, and the chance to earn subsidies for health insurance. It’s not nothing.” I might be able to produce a more efficient summary of the entire gig economy’s value to workers in 2020 than “it’s not nothing,” but only in the sense that I might be able to find my way back to civilization alive if you air-dropped me naked into the frozen tundra of the Rocky Mountains this winter. I think we’re all much better off if we just don’t shake things up. To my dismay, refusing to shake things up is essentially what California voters did at the ballot box on Election Day, too. Prop 22 passed by a not-even-close margin of 58 percent to 42 percent. As a result, the next logical question concerns the scope of the damage it will do to the most vulnerable laborers inside and outside the art economy. With the resources I have, it’s nearly impossible to quantify how many artists and arts workers in California double as drivers for Silicon Valley ventures. However, circumstantial evidence suggests that the number is large, particularly during the epochal crisis we’re weathering now. According to an April 2019 study by the National Endowment for the Arts , 34.1 percent of US artists were self-employed for the five-year period from 2012 through 2016, compared to just 9.4 percent of the general labor force. Although the NEA’s definition of “artist” aggregates everything from fine artists and dancers, to set designers and editors, to architects and musicians (and more), the organization singles out two sub-groups as having “especially high” proportions of self-employment: photographers, at roughly 56 percent; and fine artists, at roughly 54 percent. In other words, these creative professionals are about six times more likely than the average American worker to go without a salaried position, let alone other benefits that might come with a regular job. Now, it would be reasonable to conclude that some number of these same artists were already making extra cash by moonlighting as drivers in the gig economy even before the Great Shutdown of March 2020. But their ranks balloon once you factor in how deadly the crisis has been to the types of employment where artists have frequently flocked on a part-time basis. After analyzing recent government data, the Washington Post concluded the following in early October: Nine of the 10 hardest-hit industries in the coronavirus recession are services. They include performing arts, sightseeing, hotels, transportation, clothing retail, and museums. Economists worry that many of these jobs will not return , with restaurants and entertainment venues going out of business. As I wrote in response to the Post ’s findings , NEA data from 2013 estimated that somewhere between 30 percent and 60 percent of moonlighting artists held day jobs in the service sector or “educational and health services,” with the latter category including art schools and (likely) museums and other arts nonprofits. Surely, many more of those artists have had no choice but to start driving for Uber or delivering takeout for DoorDash thanks to the upheaval. The bad news nationally is even worse for California artists. Due in part to the way the state has classified art museums in its reopening plan , many institutions, including the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Hammer, and the Museum of Contemporary Art, have been closed since the spring. MOCA and the Hammer also laid off nearly 250 part-time employees combined in March. Up north, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art is welcoming visitors again, but it laid off nearly 150 on-call and full-time members of its staff this year. That’s a lot of carnage for one state’s cultural labor force. Meanwhile, the commercial sector is under duress inside and outside the Golden State’s borders. In an Art Newspaper survey of 40 “small to midsize galleries across the US” conducted last month, about 75 percent of respondents reported they face “severe financial hardship or even closure within the next year without more monetary aid” from government coffers. The turbulence has lead to an ongoing yet unknowable campaign of cost cutting and reduced activity that, along with the losses in the institutional sphere, undoubtedly thrusts hundreds, if not thousands, of artists and arts workers into the gig economy, where Prop 22 will now help ensure that they earn “not nothing”… but not much more. Worst of all, with Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi already stating in his latest earnings call that the company will now push for Prop 22-like measures in more states, these dark tidings for desperate artists and arts workers won’t be contained to the west coast for long. Going further, many industry analysts now expect Big Tech to push for overarching legislation to enshrine gig workers as independent contractors nationwide. Could the art industry help rescue itself and its workforce by following Silicon Valley’s lead at the ballot box in key states, though? Not likely, as the details of Big Tech’s successful campaign on Prop 22 make clear. I do not want to downplay the diligent, ongoing, admirable work being done by museums, dealers, their professional associations, and other related parties at the state and local levels, such as the joint quest for rent relief pursued by the Art Dealers Association of America and the New Art Dealers Alliance . But I do want to illuminate the galactic expanse separating the art world’s lobbying resources from Silicon Valley’s. To me, saying the art world is at a disadvantage to Big Tech on lobbying is an understatement on the order of saying the average Gotham City pickpocket is at a disadvantage to Batman. Uber and Lyft alone funneled more than $200 million into promoting Prop 22’s approval, according to the LA Times . This spending spree enabled a seemingly never-ending monsoon of TV spots, billboards, and mass mailings urging Californians to vote yes on the initiative for months leading up to Election Day. Even more eye-opening than the financial disparity, however, was the direct line of communication Silicon Valley had to California residents via the apps themselves. Here’s Alissa Walker in Curbed, from her appropriately headlined cannonade “ Uber and Lyft Just Bought a Law in California ”: Uber and Lyft—as well as other driver-based delivery services like DoorDash—started using their apps, which are installed on the phones of millions of California voters, to send push notifications and in-app messages warning of longer wait times, much higher prices, and dire economics for drivers if Prop 22 failed. Riders had to confirm receipt of all of this information before they could book trips. Together, Big Tech’s deep pockets, broad access, and close coordination comprise everything that the art industry lacks when it comes to advancing helpful industry-specific laws or stimulus measures. Our weird professional niche has no hope of mustering anything close to a $200 million war chest or a direct line of communication to millions of voters. Nor are its various constituents even necessarily seeking the same remedies. For instance, consider the blue-chip dealers and collectors lobbying for the federal government to reinstate the 1031 exchange that provided a workaround for capital gains taxes on investment-grade art transactions—a rule change irrelevant to the majority of dealers working with modestly priced emerging and mid-career artists. So while Big Tech leverages unparalleled money and power to laser-focus the public on a common-cause issue, the art industry must pin its hopes for legislative assistance on the slog of grassroots organizing and coalition-building. These twin realities endanger millions of vulnerable workers overall, as well as thousands with a professional stake in the arts. It’s a hard reality to stomach. Regardless of the moving vans headed to the White House, it means we’ve got a lot of work to do.

This is exciting news, to judge from Trudy Benson’s solo show at Horton . Many of her large, squarish canvases — the proportions bring to mind early Mac monitors — mimic the squiggly, uncontrollable lines and seemingly miraculous instant color-fills of 1980s graphics programs like MacPaint. (It was released in 1984, a year before Ms. Benson was born.) A few, like “Touchpad Painting” and “Tablet,” hint at more contemporary technologies with ebullient squiggles and swipe marks. The abstract “Dot, Diamond, Dash” uses seemingly every tool in the on-screen paint box: striped, solid and gradient backgrounds, thick and thin and broken lines. The reductive landscape “Moon Over Miami,” meanwhile, is a model of restraint with its peach-and-blue palette — except for the light-gray scrawl that covers the middle ground, in an apparent outburst of digital expressionism. The feverishly bright, hallucinatory paintings of Keltie Ferris , also inspired by early computer art, inevitably come to mind. But where Ms. Ferris tends to use spray paint as her top layer, Ms. Benson buries her own graffiti-esque passages under thick smears of the palette knife or squeezes of the tube.

      "{'title': 'Fools and Horses', 'unique_id': 222039, 'para': 'Mark Wallinger comes from Chigwell, in the hinterland between the eastern suburbs of London and the countryside of Essex. Essex is a sort of domesticated, Home Counties New Jersey, a land of up-market pretensions and down-market values. We make Essex jokes in the way Poles make Russian jokes; the lowest common denominators of the nation\\'s psyche and the tabloid press (maybe the two things amount to the same) decided, at the end of the 80s, that Essex was to be the scapegoat. In fact, the trend may have been started by the exceptionally dreary Ian Dury, with his Paean to Essex Man, Billericay Dickie. That said, this county of stolid yeomen does harbour its quota of off-duty criminals and flat-land hillbillies, New Town oiks, little Englanders, Tory-voting yobs and assorted dumb-fucks: much like the rest of Britain, Essex is profoundly depressing.  What kind of an artist is Mark Wallinger? An artist who has created a miniature Stonehenge out of housebricks; made deft watercolours of a dismal adventure playground; stuck a fishing lure in a bird-cage; made works variously concerned with World War II, the Holocaust, the Englishness of Englishness, his old secondary school, deposed world leaders, horse-racing... It goes on: he has almost flooded his dealer\\'s premises; done \\'slickly second rate\\' paintings of his friends whom he dressed up to look like dossers and homeless people, and has attempted to register the colours of West Ham football team with the Jockey Club.  What is he - a maverick post-conceptualist, a Duchampian object-hoarder, a Realist painter? Political satirist, naughty-boy iconoclast, or a Neo-Neo-Classicist (as one curator had it, at the time when Neo was everyone\\'s kneejerk)? These maladroit categories serve only to show the impoverishment of what passes for thought in the Art World. The more Wallinger produces, the less applicable are the labels.  Questions of identity are at the core of his project. Social structures, labels and presumptions fascinate him, and his breadth as an artist stems from a belief that only by playing with these strictures can we be liberated from them. He is even prepared to adopt and pay lip-service to the most conservative aesthetics and subject matter, only in order to trash them; or to pick on what might seem an inconsequential idea, and worry it into revealing its richness, His is an art of disguises and subterfuge.  In Passport Control (1988) he made a series of blown-up passport photos of himself, childishly doodled over with a marker pen. In one shot he gave himself a Yasser Arafat head-dress, in another the ringlets and homburg of an ultra-orthodox Jew; his face was hidden under a terrorist\\'s balaclava, and pathetically disguised with B-movie slanted eyes and Fu-Manchu moustaches, fooling no one.  Slipping through passport control, the traveller becomes a marked man: to immigration officials, we are all prime suspects. Innocence is eroded with every step we take through the customs hall. The excise man\\'s stare loads us with imaginary contraband - was that an airline meal I ate, or a condom full of cocaine? Am I constipated, or is it a bag of diamonds stuffed up my arse? A small yet hysterical inner voice wants to cry out, \\'Stop me, I\\'m guilty!\\'. And so, as we drag our baggage and our neuroses under those watchful eyes, we adopt a shifty, self-conscious nonchalance, half hoping to be found out. Something of this familiar, self-conscious unease was captured in Passport Control and in the later Stranger2 (1990), about which Wallinger noted: \"The man in the passport photobooth is failing desperately to settle in a presentable pose before the next flash of exposure. His dignity is compromised by a wayward tonsure and a booby-trapped stool.\\'  In Stranger2, discarded photo-booth mug-shots of anonymous strangers were lasercopied, duplicated and enlarged, then pasted on the undersides of three tiers of mirrors, each virtual image reflected on the mirror below. Looking down onto the little mirrored units one saw the reflected, doubled face of a stranger - two images of the stranger, one above the other, each partly obscured by its double. Standing directly above the object, I saw my own face in the uppermost mirror. Wallinger said that he\\'d been attempting to get to grips with Lacan when he made this piece. Stranger2 was like a demonstration model from a psychology lab test - to be viewed, and discussed: Be sure to note the interjection of the viewer\\'s gaze, the apparent splitting of the subject, the re-presentation of the anomalies of the mirror phase, the fragmentation and ungraspability of the Real, etcetera, etcetera. However you looked at it, wherever one stood in relation to the work, the images kept escaping, the faces - truly anonymous faces (even their owners had rejected these records of themselves) - remained partially incomplete or split, or could only be viewed at such a slanted angel that the image lost all coherence. It was the narcissism of self-regard that was booby-trapped here.  After an unhappy period at Chelsea College of Art, he took the Goldsmiths\\' MA and hit the streets with a series of \\'history paintings\\' which, with their Marxist/Materialist detachment, socio-historical erudition and fascination with the relation between art production and class, showed a remarkably adept facility at converting raw political anger into a series of critiques of the mentality of Thatcherite Britain. In doing so, he alluded to great swathes of social and cultural history. Nonconformism, the emergence of the working class, the Enlightenment, Robbie Burns, Hogarth, Stubbs, Blake, The Beatles, Wallinger\\'s mother, all were used in one way or another. Add to this dinosaurs, lavatories and the use of cardboard, wood, wool and slate, as well as oil-paint, canvas and watercolour. His technical means are as diverse as his subjects.  The paintings were, perhaps, indigestible: a rich stew, long in the pot. Maybe they attempted too much, with their references to the placid never-never land of English landscapes, oaks and Toby Jugs, Nation and patriotism and the father-figures of British art. Wallinger proceeded to vandalise these with spray-can graffiti and jarring disjunctions. Cocking a snook at the dominant attitudes of the moment, including the essential conservatism of the Neo-romanticist paintings in vogue at the time, he adopted both the mannerisms and assumed pedigree of precisely that which he wished to criticise.  The trouble was that you could always hear the dull clank and hiss of the allegorical machinery grinding away in the background. The references started jamming the cogs. But Wallinger was never a hectoring Comrade or a Dave Spart, and if the work used history in order to demythologise it, the artist also recognised the complexity of the issues. There was nothing shabbily disingenuous or fashionably retro in his adoption of art-historical and social motifs. Returning to some of these themes in more recent paintings, it is clear that a lesson has been learned.  The references to nationalism, state control, mythologising as forgetting, racism and class permeate most, but not all the work. The allusions in Wallinger\\'s work are often arrived at elliptically; there are times when he tries to see the world as a Martian (or a Martian poet) might.  A heap of discarded spectacles, with toy sheep and four-eyed faces hanging in frames, overlooking the pile (Sins and Virtues), dealt with the holocaust; the Subbuteo football game mounted on a plinth which conflated the 1966 world soccer cup with both World War II and the decline of Britain since 1945 (They Think It\\'s All Over... It is Now); and the reference to a poem by Rupert Brook in the magical Heaven, which was nothing more than an angler\\'s lure, a streamlined fake-fish with barbed treble hooks, suspended in a gilded bird-cage. These disconcerting collisions of objects and allusions in his 1988 show at Anthony Reynolds Gallery showed that Wallinger was capable, as an object-poet, of using objects not as cryptograms, so much as tart epigrams and metaphors for the most complex issues. We\\'d snag ourselves on these barbs, as on the fisherman\\'s hook.  There is something of the esprit d\\'escalier about this vein of Wallinger\\'s work. The Genius of Venice (1991), presented seven pages of the Royal Academy\\'s catalogue to the exhibition of that name, illuminated from the rear. The image on the reverse page was visible through the paper; thus the face of a bearded man shone through as a ghostly presence around the crotch of a reclining female nude, and the face of a youth became an apparition behind the head of an older man. The work was derived from a simple circumstantial observation, revealing a wealth of meanings.  Whatever would lead Wallinger to make outline drawings of the classrooms, gym and woodwork shop of his old secondary school, on blackboards, and to illuminate the vanishing-point of the drawings with lightbulbs set into the boards (School, 1990)? What labyrinthine process led to his installation of a hosepipe (Fountain,1992) fixed at one end to a tap in the basement of Anthony Reynolds Gallery, and coiled and snaked up the stairs, across the hardwood floor, to emerge at crotch-height through a small hole in the plate-glass window, where the nozzle spurted a dribbling stream into the street? Of course, the work was not intended as a riposte to the ludicrous willie-show (as it came to be known) curated by Jeffrey Deitch and opening on the same night across the street at d\\'Offay\\'s; it was mere serendipity.  Mark Wallinger is one of culture\\'s omnivores. Ideas for projects seem to pour out of him (was the hosepipe a self-portrait?). But for the last two years he has, along with his other projects, been engaged in the production of two series of inordinately time-consuming paintings. The first, Capital (1991) debunked the staid values of the official portrait with a number of paintings of friends, posed as derelicts, society\\'s losers, in front of the hallowed and imposing doorways of major financial institutions in the City. He brought to bear all the academic techniques and compositional devices of quasi-realist portraiture to these paintings, with their varnished glazes, careful modelling and concentration on detail. A second series (both have been purchased by Charles Saatchi) is just being completed. The paintings demand the most tedious skills and application. Yet Wallinger is not to be confused with all those painter\\'s painters for whom the medium has definitely become the massage parlour. That said, he will also admit - with some sorrow - to being a sport-bore; a football, cricket and horse-racing bore. Addicted to the turf from an early age, the infant Mark even placed bets and quibbled the odds with Uncle Dick, who ran an undoubtedly illicit family book. As a prelude to a recent visit to Wallinger\\'s studio, I was treated to a three hour disquisition on the racing game. His eyes assumed a far-away look, and he gesticulated like a man in control of imaginary reins.  I am singularly unqualified to discuss the ostensible subject of Wallinger\\'s most recent paintings. I\\'ve never spent a day at the races and wouldn\\'t begin to know how to place a bet. I am now in possession of more information on the topic than is good for me, coming from somewhat puritan, Cromwellian stock, for whom betting would be an immoral activity, on a par with hanging out washing \\'of a Sunday\\'. Wallinger, from Essex, suffers no such scruples: The Wallingers, I\\'m certain, hang out washing whenever they choose. I mention this because, in his newest works, breeding is everything. The four paintings, all derived from the stilted photographs which appear in a book called Stallions of 1991, depict life-sized racehorses, and the title of the work is Race, Class, Sex.  Soviet Star, Shareef Dancer, Reference Point and Dancing Brave are all descended, through a direct male line, from Darley Arabian, an Arab stallion brought to this country by the brother of a Mr Thomas Darley of Yorkshire. Darley Arabian, born in 1700, is the progenitor of the strongest line of thoroughbred, racing horseflesh in the country. His son, Eclipse (B.1764) was painted by Stubbs (the painting is owned by Paul Mellon). Wallinger\\'s horses are all owned by Sheik Mohammed, of the ruling Maktoum family in Dubai. Brother of the Prime Minister, Mohammed is Minister of Defence.  There they stand, these four bays. Each isolated against a blank white background, each on its own canvas, sixteen or so hands high. Every detail, of fetlock, wither, crop and belly is faithfully recorded. The pose is the same for each horse, as it is for all the horses in Weatherby\\'s Stallions of \\'91. They face the left, in a vague sort of horsey contraposto. The original photos are black and white but Wallinger has faithfully coloured them in. The reins lead off the paintings to an invisible handler, cropped out of the picture; a proud owner whom we cannot see.  They are frightfully well done. Wallinger recently visited two of the major trainers at Newmarket, by way of research, and presumably to acquire some hot tips and perhaps an invitation to the nob\\'s enclosure at some meet or other. He was gratified to learn that these somewhat alarming characters, for whom the arcane world of racing means everything, recognised the horses at a glance. What they failed to recognise, perhaps, was Wallinger\\'s attention to the politics of sport.  Mucking-out, breaking-in, training, exercising, preparing the horse for the unpleasant ordeal of the race itself (Wallinger was assured that the horses detest racing) is the daily round of the racing fraternity, but it is a world where pedigree, class and form matter as much for the individuals involved in the sport as it does for the animals themselves. The redoubt of the feudal system informs every aspect of racing - and affects Essex punter, humble stable-lad and Royal patron alike. The Jockey Club, the thoroughly undemocratic, ruling junta of the game, determines everything. Racing provides a model of the world which continues to hold sway in Merrie England, as much as it does in Latin American dictatorships and Eastern potentates. It is a reflection of the world where identity, race, sex and class counts for everything, don\\'t y\\'know.

      "{'title': 'Peter Piller', 'unique_id': 220467, 'para': 'A long row of square black and white photographs ofnothing but bus stops: some of them simple concrete slabs, some with corrugated iron roofs, some like garden sheds, a few with brick arches, others made of timber and encrusted with posters. Despite the echoes of Bernd and Hilla Becher, everything is different: the neutralizing perfection is missing, the weather is even worse and the empty roadside shelters feel staged, as if a single photograph could capture the sadness of youth in the provinces. For Peter Piller also sees the subjects of the Bushaltestellen series (Bus Stops, 1990–92) as village centres: places where people go to meet, where people wait to get away. On the opposite wall were small-format colour images of forsythias in bloom, repeated over and over. Piller spent one spring collecting them for Forsythienblüte (Forsythia Blossoms, 1994), which shows the bright yellow-flowered shrubs against grey rendering, enlivening rubbish bins and lining lonely street corners. It seems that concrete is the natural habitat for these scraggy, forlorn bushes. Their solitude is topped only by the pullovers, hats and jackets that Piller has found: tangled up in branches, lying in puddles, stretched out on the muddy ground. Dirty, wet and washed out, they resemble pictures from the scene of a crime, clues to as yet unknown atrocities. The way these Fundstücke (Found Objects, 1995–2004) are hung, there is space left in the bottom row, as if for future graves in a cemetery, and one finds oneself hoping that this is a just a reference to people having lost objects, not their lives. Piller’s one-man exhibition at the Museum für Gegenwartskunst highlighted his work as a photographer, which is significant because he is known above all for his work with existing pictures found in archives: he. works three days a week for the Carat media agency, combing the announcements pages of regional papers from the Magdeburger Volksstimme to the Süderländer Volksfreund. Among the standard fare of local reporting there is not much room for quality photojournalism: awards ceremonies, land offered for building development, and anniversaries are documented by semi-professional photographers at best, and there are occasions, such as award ceremonies and car launches, whose original meaning and purpose have entirely dissolved into the ‘photo opportunity’. Piller finds these and files them away in folders with names such as: ‘Weapons Used’, ‘Inaugural Ribbons’, ‘Eyesore and Joy to Behold’. For some years now Revolver-Verlag has been publishing these collections as A5-format catalogues bound in grey – more than 20 further volumes are planned. In the second room of the museum Piller has made a selection from his archive, filling an entire wall with poster-size inkjet prints of grainy newspaper images enlarged up to 100 times. The hanging is slightly reminiscent of Wolfgang Tillmans – but this time the absurd, idiosyncratic aura exuded by firemen photographed with too much flash and a 100-year-old woman adds up to a panorama of life not in urban environments but specifically in the German provinces. In the next room Piller presents two of his collections of found material as series: a batch of aerial photographs of German owner-occupied homes – pictures that were supposed to be flogged to the proud house owners at a later date by door-to-door salesmen – and colourful pictures of missiles and projectiles that were apparently offered for sale on eBay. An eerie mixture: while from above the houses all look alike – Piller sorts them according to poetic-sounding but highly formal categories such as ‘Sleeping Houses’ (with closed shutters) or ‘Red Tongues’ (where bright red bedding has been hung out to air) – inside, a puzzling anti-culture seems to reign: the small metal rockets, probably packed with explosives, lie regally on decorative cushions and flowery velour carpets, or take their place on the mantelpiece between porcelain figures like sports trophies. The juxtaposition suggests an alien suburban world, both banal and dangerous. These photographic ready-mades taken from commercial contexts are slightly reminiscent of Martin Parr’s pictures taken in suburban homes or the amateur photos that Hans-Peter Feldmann has been collecting from flea markets for decades, but they are less voyeuristic. It is their commercial utility value and their barely veiled triviality that prevents these pictures from being essays in cultural criticism. Piller, the collector who works at an agency to pay the bills, deliberately avoids the significant, tell-tale motifs of advanced corporate communication – which distinguishes him from fellow image recyclers such as Richard Prince, who deliberately plunder the glamour and seduction of advertising for their work. Which is why this reluctant office worker can finally also take the office as his theme – the catalogue he produced with the prize money from the Rubens Prize of the City of Siegen looks from the outside like a file; it contains a pad of paper, each page bearing the logo of his employer, the Carat agency. Every page is full of little sketches of the corridors, caricatures of co-workers, letters in wobbly typescript, scrawled daydreams and ‘office dialogues’ in handwritten capitals: ‘OK, I’M OUT OF HERE – GOOD’.   |', 'author': 'CATRIN LORCH', 'url': ['https://www.frieze.com/article/peter-piller'], 'tags': None, 'captions': None, 'pubtime': datetime.datetime(2005, 4, 12, 0, 0), 'source': 'Frieze'}\n",

French Photography Glossary and Museum List', 'unique_id': 241943, 'para': 'Rue Lanneau Sophie Calle , The view of my life from the series: The Autobiographies, Welcome to the third article in our French glossary series! This time, we are focusing on photography. First of all, let’s talk about etymology! The word photography was invented by John Herschel in the mid-19th-century and derives from the Greek phοtos , which means light, and graphé , which means drawing or writing. So, photography is a technique that literally “draws with light,” using it to create an image. Since 1826, when the first photograph was taken, photography has evolved from daguerreotypes to C-prints to digital photographs. We will introduce you to photography through specific terms related to this artistic medium, and a presentation of several French museums and art galleries devoted to photography that you should visit during your next trip to France! Let’s discover photography through a French eye. PHOTOGRAPHS TERMINOLOGY A–Z: English French  A SELECTION OF PHOTOGRAPH CENTERS IN FRANCE:  Maison de la Photographie–Lille  About : There are five Maisons de la Photographie worldwide, with centers in Mali, Marrakech, Moscow, Lille, and Paris. Located in the north of France, Maison de la Photographie in Lille was inaugurated in 2003, and was created to support local art and artists through debates, exhibitions and events. The Maison also hosts the Transphotographiques Festival, whose Willy Ronis (French, 1910–2009) was the first godfather, and hosts selected exhibitions all around the city. For more than 10 years, the festival has featured works by many well-known photographers, including Peter Lindbergh (German, b.1944), William Klein (American, b.1928), and Bettina Rheims (French, b.1952), among others. Thanks to a partnership with the Maison Européenne de la Photographie à Paris, the Maison de la Photographie de Lille is now MEP-Lille.  Did you know? The Maison de la Photographie was created in Lille on the 200th anniversary of the birth of Louis Désiré Blanquart-Evrard (French, 1802–1872), a significant photographer in Lille during the early 19th century.  Address : 18 rue Frémy – 59000 Lille  Website:  http://www.maisonphoto.com/  Hours:  Open: 10 a.m.–6 p.m., Tuesday through Wednesday, and 2 p.m.–6 p.m., Saturday; Closed: Sunday and Monday Maison Européenne de la Photographie–Paris  About : Opened in 1996, the Maison Européenne de la Photographie (or MEP) is located in the Hotel Henault de Cantobre in the fourth arrondissement of Paris. The building houses an exhibition center, a large library, an auditorium, and a video library, as well as a restoration and conservation workshop. With a permanent collection of nearly 20,000 photographs, the MEP has featured works by a number of well-known artists, including Helmut Newton (German, 1920–2004) and Irving Penn (American, 1917–2009). Between three and four exhibitions are held at the MEP every year, which focus mainly on artists and movements of the mid-20th and early 21st centuries. In addition, one of the MEP’s central missions is to preserve the photographic patrimony of the libraries, archives, and museums of Paris.  Did you know? Henry Chapier, famous French movie critic, journalist, and TV host, is the President of the MEP.  Address : 5/7 rue de Fourcy — 75004 Paris  Website:  http://www.mep-fr.org/  Hours:  Open: 11 a.m.–8 p.m., Wednesday through Sunday; Closed: Monday and Tuesday Le Jeu de Paume hors les murs –Paris  About : In 1861, the building was originally built for tennis, or Jeu de Paume (literally, “palm game”), under Napoléon III. In 1909, it became an art space in collaboration with the Musée de l’Orangerie and the Louvre. The Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume house foreign collections, but during World War II the building and the artworks were confiscated by the Nazis. From 1947 to 1986, the museum exhibited Impressionist paintings and soon became a national gallery, featuring Modern and Contemporary Art. In 2004, the museum became exclusively devoted to photography, video, and experimental cinema. And since 2007, Jeu de Paume expanded its reach, developing a virtual space on the Internet, which presents works created especially for the web. Jeu de Paume also has partnerships with several national and international institutions all around the world. In 2013, Jeu de Paume is presenting works from Lorna Simpson (American, b.1960), Erwin Blumenfeld (German, 1897–1969), and Willy Ronis.  Did you know? In 2010, Jeu de Paume partnered with Château de Tours to create exhibitions focusing on historic photographs, with the intention of reaching a larger audience. Today, Jeu de Paume is made up of the Galerie Nationale du Jeu de Paume, the Centre National de la Photographie, and Patrimoine Photographique.  Address : 1 place de la Concorde — 75008 Paris  Website : http://www.jeudepaume.org/  Hours: Open: 11 a.m.–7 p.m., Wednesday through Sunday, and 11 a.m.–9 p.m. on Tuesday; Closed: Monday LE BAL – Paris  About : LE BAL was born out of a project by the Association des Amis de Magnum, whose president is photographer and documentary filmmaker Raymond Depardon (French, b.1942). LE BAL’s mission is to create an independent location dedicated to the representation of the reel through photography, video, cinema, and new media. From Walker Evans (American, 1903–1975) to Jeff Wall (Canadian, b.1946), LE BAL presents an open space for Contemporary Art. In 2006, it became an exhibition venue, a bookstore, and a coffee shop. And since 2008, LE BAL has hosted an educational platform called La Fabrique du Regard dedicated to teaching high school students how to look at images. In early 2013, LE BAL organized a very successful exhibition dedicated to Antoine D’Agata, and is now displaying artworks from Bas Jan Ader (Dutch, 1942–1975), Taiyo Onorato, and Nico Krebs.  Did you know? During the Roaring Twenties, the building which hosts LE BAL was a cabaret, brothel, and a ballroom. Between World War II and 1992, LE BAL was the biggest betting shop in France.

The building was inaugurated in 1972 and contains almost 3 million images from the 19th and 20th centuries, as well as more than 1,500 cameras. Its mission is to provide a history of photography from its invention to today’s digital imagery. The museum displays professional prints alongside amateur works. In the past, the museum has held exhibitions about André Steiner (Austrian/Hungarian, 1901–1978), Malick Sidibé (Malian, b.1936), and Robert Doisneau (French, 1912–1994), and it is currently displaying artworks by Klavdij Sluban (French, b.1953) and Stanley Greene (American, b.1949).  Did you know? Point de vue du Gras is the name of the first photograph in history, which was taken by Niepce in 1826 from the window of his home.

After being recognized by the French Ministry of Culture, the project of Centre d’art contemporain photographique was born in 2011, and took place in four different locations in the city of Niort. In March 2013, Villa Pérochon was inaugurated. Its 1,400 sq. ft. garden and gallery is used as a space for exhibitions, and promotes both young and established artists. The Belvédère au Moulin du Roc is a 1,000 sq. ft. exhibition gallery in the heart of the city, nested close to the photography workshop called Le Coin Photo. The Fort Foucault, a residency for artists, is located in a 19th century villa built on the remains of a medieval fortress.  Did you know? The Villa Pérochon is a patrimonial site, and the former home of the writer Ernest Pérochon, Goncourt Prize winner of 1920.

      "{'title': 'On Neuroaesthetics, or the Productive Exercise of Looking at Art', 'unique_id': 138217, 'para': 'We now know that certain forms of visual art increase connectivity and plasticity in our brains when we engage with their nebulous compositional propositions. Such alternative, neuroplastic wonderlands are something that Jonathan Fineberg is tackling as director of an emerging art-science Ph.D. program at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia. The program’s budding syllabus is something of an apogee to Fineberg’s carer, building on his experiences as Professor of Art History Emeritus at the University of Illinois and Trustee Emeritus of the Phillips Collection in Washington, DC — where he was founding Director of the Center for the Study of Modern Art. In preparation for this endeavor, Fineberg studied psychoanalysis at the Boston and Western New England Psychoanalytic Institutes. He has curated numerous exhibitions and received numerous awards, including the Pulitzer Fellowship in Critical Writing, the NEA Art Critic’s Fellowship, senior fellowships from the Dedalus Foundation and the Japan Foundation, and the College Art Association’s Award for Distinguished Teaching in the History of Art. Recently, I talked with him about the innovative neuroaesthetic Ph.D. program that he and his colleagues are now developing at the University of the Arts; about Donald Trump, art, and politics; and about his newest book on modern art and neuroaesthetics, Modern Art at the Border of Mind and Brain . * * * Joseph Nechvatal:  After hearing this summer about your move to the University of the Arts in Philadelphia so as to develop a new and very unique Ph.D. program in creativity that accentuates neuroaesthetics , I picked up your book Modern Art at the Border of Mind and Brain (University of Nebraska Press) and read it in one long bolt. It nippily engaged me with an astute exploratory interface between neuroscience and modern art. For the modern art side, you draw mostly on the work of Robert Motherwell, Joan Miró, Alexander Calder, Christo and Jeanne-Claude, Pablo Picasso and Jean Dubuffet. Your personal experiences with some of these artists are riveting, but I found your approach much broader than the title suggests. You pepper your book with an image from 28,000 BCE: a painting from the cave of Chauvet, which holds the world’s oldest known cave paintings (between six and ten times older than the first forms of written language). You also discuss a 19th-century magical African sculpture from the Kongo and images of Chartres Cathedral. And there are more recent, postmodern artists under consideration in the book: Andy Warhol, David Wojnarowicz, Andrea Fraser, and Buzz Spector. Still, the thrust of your inquiry seems to me to be a scuffle between neuroaesthetics and the Dada and Surrealist styles that stemmed from the unconscious. This psychoanalytic approach based in chance and dreams — which travels in irrational enigma — comes into contact at the end of the book with recent rational approaches of neuroaesthetics. In that sense, your book (and, I presume, your new Ph.D. program) attempts to bridge the gap between hard-science neural biology and post-Dada art aesthetics. You suggest that the complex enigmas posed by some modern and postmodern art contain a rich cultural activity for brain biology to study, but they are also the way that ordinary human brains may gain greater elasticity. Miró’s “Drawing-Collage” (1933) and Picasso’s Cubist portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler (1910) seem to both be great examples, which you use well. At the book’s end, you seem to suggest that some overly rational neural approaches to art — some that stemmed from Dr. Semir Zeki’s Institute of Neuroaesthetics — are too reductionist to understand the rupturing that visual-mental noise needs in forming great art that challenges and moves us. It seems to me that you wish to retain an emphasis on the unconscious in light of neural science. Does this detainment of noisy enigma undercut neuroaesthetics’ benefits? Are you suggesting that brain science will never suffice? Jonathan Fineberg: You definitely did understand me correctly and I appreciate getting such a thoughtful read. Although I do want to say something about Zeki. He is a brilliant scientist who completely gets the power of art. It’s not reductive to use everything we know from a scientific perspective as we attempt to grasp what happens in the brain when we look at a painting or listen to a piece of music. It’s only a partial view of course, and Zeki is the first to acknowledge that we don’t yet have the tools to see what we’d really like to see there, let alone comprehend its dynamics. His work and mine are about trying to enlarge our understanding with any means we can find. I don’t want to speak for Zeki, but I don’t think he believes any more than I do that we can ultimately reduce aesthetic experience to a chemical description. It was reading Zeki and conversing with him that gave me the idea that we could extrapolate a great deal that is not knowable with today’s science by examining a work of art and attempting to reverse engineer, so to speak, the sequencing of the brain. As an example, I tried to do this by carefully analyzing a late painting by Dubuffet called “Fluence” (1984). It was also Zeki who suggested to me that if we’re still making images after 30,000 years when written language has only been around for 3,000, we must need them for some enduring reason. Where that line of reasoning took me was the speculation at the end of the book that art (though not only art) exercises the ability of the brain to perceive and creatively adapt to new realities, which is a fundamental survival skill. It’s very helpful to think about the physiology of the eye to understand why this is so. First, the human retina has about a billion and a half cells, mostly receptors of different sorts, and the optic nerve which carries the information to the visual processing centers in the brain has less than half that number of cells. So there must already be some level of processing going on in the retina before the data goes to the optic nerve. Furthermore, that information is carried by the optic nerve entirely by electrical impulses. Why? Because speed is important and chemical transmission (which happens nearly everywhere else in the brain) is slower. Lastly, the scientific evidence suggests that most of what we think we see comes from visual processing, perhaps just 20% comes from the actual input to the retina. Again, what is the evolutionary purpose of this? If we encounter a predator and had to construct what we’re seeing from scratch each time, we’d get eaten. So the brain searches the closest match that is already constructed in memory and modifies it with new input from the eye so we can figure out fast if we need to run for it. Looking at art exercises our ability to innovate images. JN:  Besides your becoming a professor at University of the Arts, you are Trustee Emeritus of the Phillips Collection , where you were the founding Director of the Center for the Study of Modern Art. In the footnotes of your book, I learned that in 2006 you organized a conference that Zeki attended entitled “Art and the Brain” at the Phillips Collection. Research in neuroaesthetics involves measuring brain activity by using medical technology like fMRI machines as subjects look at works of art. It also involves looking at people with different brain disorders to see how this affects their ability to appreciate or create art. Have there been brain-art breakthroughs since 2006 that spurred you on to develop this new Ph.D. program at the University of the Arts? JF: I intended the symposium at the Phillips Collection to put art and neuroscience together to see in what ways they might each illuminate the other. First, I love objects and that’s why I love the Phillips Collection. I also love the smell of the studio, so to speak, and I came to the University of the Arts in Philadelphia because it’s an art school and it’s all about “making” on a very high level. I met the brilliant new president of the University of the Arts, David Yager , at a meeting of the National Academies of Science and Engineering last year. We got into a conversation about Modern Art at the Border of Mind and Brain and after this conversation I knew that retiring to write full time just wasn’t in the cards for me anymore; I had to go work with this guy. I’m only in my first months on the job but my task is to help him create a Ph.D. in creativity: a kind of bespoke Ph.D. for individuals wanting to pursue a high-level project for which there is no Ph.D. program anywhere. I feel like Barnett Newman must have felt painting paintings that he knew wouldn’t fit in his gallery ( Betty Parsons ). He had to carry them out onto the street just to turn them around. Like Newman, David Yager and my colleagues at UArts are attempting to create something radically new that doesn’t fit in the available boxes. We want to see if the right infusion of the arts into the practice of any profession or scholarly inquiry can make a more creative practitioner and the idea comes right out something I played with especially in the last chapter of Modern Art at the Border of Mind and Brain , looking at the enigmatic experience of the work of art. Reading Zeki started me thinking about how creative problem solving might work in the brain on a very physical level. We constantly need to redesign the synaptic connections in the brain to deal with the complex realities we encounter every day. The brain is the fastest evolving organism in the human body. When you use an fMRI to look at visual processing in the brain you see that the brain doesn’t just rely on the visual processing centers to create a mental image of what’s in front of the eyes, it goes searching all the available resources in the brain to see what can be brought to bear on the problem. The human brain is distinguished by its very large cerebral cortex, which is a dense bundle of complex connections between brain cells. If you look on the web, as I just did, you’ll read that “the frontal lobes are involved in motor function, problem solving, spontaneity, memory, language, initiation, judgement, impulse control, and social and sexual behavior.” What else is there?! It is a constantly evolving web of pathways for assembling meaning and acting on it. What I learned from the science helped me grasp the dynamics, but it certainly didn’t reduce art to a predictable formula. This helped me understand why the ultimately unresolvable, unknowable nature of a great work of art prepares us to survive, because, as Paul Valéry famously said, “the trouble with the future is that it isn’t what it used to be,” and art helps us adapt. JN:  I enjoyed the way your book built up to neuroaesthetics through the elusive problem of form you identified and framed through a Freudian understanding of repression in the abstract representation of Motherwell’s mark making. I believe this was based on your investigation of Motherwell that you developed working closely with him for an essay in Artforum in 1978. This opening chapter deepened my understanding of his and your work. You then led me to a better understanding of Miró’s and Calder’s equally (and prior) abstract grammar that was also illuminated in terms of abstract visual thinking. This quality of abstract openness seems to me the central challenge to neuroaesthetics, and I would add to artificial intelligence. You focus in on the importance for good art of a mental and visceral openness that escapes certitude to the point where the formal definition of the work of art itself (via Duchamp) is open to interpretation — something Umberto Eco also identified well in his book The Open Work . I have been thinking about that tolerant openness in culture since the election of Donald Trump as US President. Your political chapter stresses subtle political engagements through abstract visual grammar — but it was written before Trump came to power and changed American culture. Abstract subtlety seems threatened by crude pop obviousness now; subtle, abstract thinking and visual complexity are perhaps more important (albeit fragile) than ever. To understand the Trumpian mindset, I watched Steve Bannon’s 2010 documentary film Generation Zero , in which he, in terms of extreme historical urgency, basically blames cultural openness (rather than the greed of developers and the Wall Street bankers) as the cause of the financial crisis of 2007–08 that brought the backlash to globalization and the Trump wave behind it. In the film, Bannon predicts with moral zeal a cleaning out of the old cultural order of openness so as to build a new nationalist populism in its place. He calls this a great (fourth) turning . Since the surprising and shocking Trump election, have you re-thought your chapter on art and politics, with its emphasis on iconic abstract specificity as a liberating mode of expression of primal instincts? JF: Obviously, this is on all of our minds; it’s hard to watch the demise of American democracy and influence. But I don’t think art can fix that directly. However, I do believe art can alter the terms on which we meet the world. The projects of Christo and Jeanne-Claude do this on a very large scale, which is intriguing. They do so by engendering a radical openness among large numbers of people and that experience transcends political loyalties. The result is real political change through empathic collaboration and insight into the mechanisms which govern our immediate reality. The work is so beautiful it unhinges the hierarchies with which we approach things. I like to say that a great work of art is like falling in love: it’s terrifying to let another person into your psychic organization so deeply and yet you can’t fall in love without doing that. Opening up comes from having faith in a profoundly gratifying relationship which gives you the confidence to let go a little. That is exactly what a Christo and Jeanne-Claude project does to people and indeed what all great works of art do. In the book, I quoted some remarks by Freud that come from the preamble to his essay on “The Moses of Michelangelo” in which he said that when we are really moved by a great work of art we experience something that we can’t explain and it bewilders us. Michelangelo’s sculpture had that affect on Freud although Freud wants to deny it, saying he can’t derive any pleasure from a work of art unless he can explain how it affects him. It’s remarkable that Freud could be so clear about his neurotic defense and nevertheless be absolutely correct that we have to allow this feeling of bewilderment in order to benefit from a work of art. We are awe-struck in the presence of Christo and Jeanne-Claude projects, in front Michelango’s “Moses,” the Cathedral of Chartres, Andrea Fraser’s performances, or any other great work of art and if it touches us profoundly it disorganizes us emotionally, taking down some of our defenses and making us more available to engage other people. I sense your frustration that art and intellectual conversations like this one aren’t able to do more about the terrifying political reality we find ourselves in right now. I also understand your conundrum with regard to neuroscience’s attempt to “explain” things. With regard to the former, I believe that since World War Two we have more and more outsourced parenting to coaches, guidance counsellors, teachers, pediatricians, social service agencies, and mandated behavioral “guidelines” to the point that we have eroded parental role models. Parents used to bear the responsibility of transmitting culture and this provided role model on which young egos formed. The boundaries around a firm idea of oneself have been diffused by mass marketing and consumerism. We sense that inner void and attempt to fill it up with possessions and define ourselves increasingly in terms of what others value. This is at the heart of the epidemic of narcissism that has arisen over the past half century. The megalomaniacs on Wall Street (but not only Wall St.) come from an insatiable hunger to fill that inner void. My book A Troublesome Subject: The Art of Robert Arneson turns on this argument. But great works of art — whether Christo and Jeanne-Claude, the builders of Chartres Cathedral, the socially engaged artists like Theaster Gates , the expressionism of a painter like Goya, the raw vulnerability which we all instantly feel in Andrea Fraser’s work, or the profound humanism of the paintings of Kerry James Marshall , to cite just a few examples — get people to open up to one another on a human level rather than on an ideological level. This is how art works, slowly but profoundly, on a culture. I also want to return to your other concern about the reductive potential of neuroaesthetics. I don’t believe science necessarily leads to reductive explanations nor that it levels individuality. The complexity of the human brain, the quantity of data, the sheer number of cells involved in any significant activity is so great as to introduce an infinite set of variations. Complexity Theory and quantum point to an inherent and ineradicable unpredictability that, as you said, makes me believe that we can never reduce the creative productivity of the human mind to a formula. We can, however, learn a lot about how it works and knowing that enhances our productivity and success at doing things. JN:  Clearly your positive attitude is reflected in your book, which I should add is based on your Presidential Lectures at the University of Nebraska. The illustrated narrative you weave does a great job of opening up for consideration the relationship between artistic production, neuroscience, and the way we make personal and political meaning in art. But how about we talk a bit more about the uncertain, open, and deconstructive process of art that right wing reactionary politics and the hard science of neuroaesthetics has a hard time with by considering the previously mentioned Dubuffet painting, “Fluence”? It was one of the paintings I saw in Pace Gallery’s 2012 show of late Dubuffet paintings . “Fluence,” an abstract network image, was chosen for your book’s cover and you dwell on it in the final seven pages of your book to close your argument, so obviously it is an important work for you. After investigating the ocular grammar of visual noise, and considering it as visual glossolalia in my book on cultural noise Immersion Into Noise , I found your analysis of what you call the aspatial quality of “Fluence” suggestive of what I found to be the importance of excess in a deconstructive glossolalia that entails a collapse of figure and ground distinctions. Am I correct to say that fluid, layered, simultaneous aspatiality is at the core of your evolutionary theory of visual art? I think that as much as we need to organize our thoughts and politics and represent them in our memory, we need also to undo those patterns through visually ambiguous and excessive aesthetic experiences. I discovered this through my early drawings and then within the engraved Apse of Lascaux, where my gaze was overwhelmed by an all-inclusive flood of sublimated optic information. What fascinated me about the Apse was exactly its cryptic, all-over iconographic character (what Bataille called its fouillis ). The Apse’s imagery (if we can call it that) — like “Fluence” — has a boundless, palimpsest-like, and explosive quality that requires visual stamina, but it is not fully abstract. It is made up of overlapping near non-photo-reproducible drawings from which, when sustained visual attention is maintained, other unexpected configurations visually emerge. Here, animal forms are superimposed in chaotic discourse, some fully and carefully rendered, others unfulfilled and left open to penetration by the environment, all commingled with an extraordinary confused jumble of lines. Its extensive use of superimposed multiple-operative optic perception presents the viewer with no single point of reference, no orientation, no top, no bottom, no left, no right, and no separate parts to its whole. Such visual thought is outside of spatiality; something deeply suggestive of the non-spatial character of consciousness itself. It struck me that its transcending of differentiation seemed an imposition onto Paleolithic culture of the very thing that should destabilize it: nihilism. Nihilism in that it is no longer a matter of perceiving heterogeneous figuration, but of scanning a homospatial criss-crossing and oscillating battle scene between interwoven figures, immersed in their ideational ground with which they have merged in a deliberate process of constitutional de-figurization. This does not align with your belief in the powers of social reformation based on interpersonal engagements around art, but does it line up with your evolutionary research on perception and art? Do you think that such nihilistic noisy excess is beneficial and may even include the pleasure of social communion? JF: I love your description of seeing the “bewildering” (Freud’s word) Apse of the Cave at Lascaux. It is precisely what I wanted to convey about Dubuffet’s painting “Fluence.” You can never entirely resolve it into a single reading and that “fluidity” forces you to continue to regroup as you look at it. Aspatiality is only a part of the larger deconstructive power, to use your term, of these works of art. I like that you speak of “explosiveness” and the need for “stamina” because this chaotic turn in consciousness is a powerful force to reckon with. The distinction between figuration and abstraction is also complicated by the way the fluidity of the mind brings them together conceptually. It’s not that we have “transcended differentiation” or spatiality but that our minds move discrete ideas around, juxtaposing them to one another in constantly new ways that may defy linear logic. It is certainly true that science (and for that matter art history) focuses on details and advances by little steps. But that doesn’t mean that we can’t use what we’ve learned to speculate broadly nor does it mean that we will ever explain away our creativity. This is the anxiety of every creative person who goes into psychoanalysis too: will I lose my creativity if I understand my neurosis? In fact, the opposite is true; psychoanalysis liberates creativity just as careful scientific work opens new questions we couldn’t have thought of before and enables the brain to do even more. Sometimes a little discovery can blast away a monumental superstructure in thought, like the Michelson–Morley experiment which was performed to demonstrate the effect of the aether winds on the speed of light; but it just didn’t work and that failure led to the discovery of special relativity and sent aether winds to the dust bin. So when you asked about my art theory, I would say it centers on how humans use works of art to bring coherence to their experience and to interact with other human beings. But it also values the constant stirring up of fixed ideas as an exhilarating path to innovation. I don’t see any conflict with science and while some scientists are deterministic, others accept the kind of radical and perpetual revision of reality by the ideas embodied in works of art that you and I both appreciate so much. Part of what sets artists apart is their tolerance for the messy disorder of the world; in general, people want to clean up (giving us the sensation of bringing things under control; whereas thing are never really in control). My friend Harold Rosenberg once remarked to me that, in contrast to Clement Greenberg who liked everything ordered in straight lines, Rosenberg and I belonged to what he called “the wild man party.” Perhaps I ought to close by saying that we don’t really know anything about the future except that it won’t be like the present. If you want strong abs you do a lot of sit-ups, but if you want to increase the agility of your brain to respond to the unexpected, art is a great form of exercise.

      "{'title': 'Sculptors Pay Tribute to an 18th-Century Botanist in Wood', 'unique_id': 135836, 'para': 'Long before North Americans could pick up tomato  seedlings at their local hardware store, there was John Bartram . The 18th-century horticulturist supplied seeds to the likes of Thomas Jefferson and established the US’s first botanical garden near the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia. But what gardening enthusiasts mostly remember him for are his boxes — 3-x-2-1/2-foot containers that he carefully packed with plant specimens and then shipped off to prospective buyers in Europe. Bartram’s boxes quite literally gave seed to a new European landscape peppered with American foliage — everything from morning glories to poison ivy. More recently, they have inspired a remarkable series of artworks at the Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum in Wausau, Wisconsin. It all began in June 2010, when a violent storm knocked down 13 varieties of trees in the 45-acre park called Bartram’s Garden that now occupies the botanist’s old estate in Philadelphia. The organization partnered with the local Center for Art in Wood and put out a call for artists to create modern remixes of Bartram’s boxes from the fallen timber. The results — 36 projects, first exhibited at the center last year — are incredibly thoughtful and detailed. Highlights include Nathan Hansen’s “131 Rings” (2013), which features the remains of a 131-year-old tree; its ring-lined trunk has been sliced horizontally into several sections that rotate with the passing of time, so the very top layer makes one new revolution each year. Benn Colker ‘s “Museum of the Maker’s Hand” (2013) is a miniature, traveling museum that contains several “gallery” boxes filled with tiny specimens symbolic of the creative act. Bartram, who had a deep appreciation for the little things in life, would no doubt have been impressed.

      "{'title': 'Frieze Art Fair Is Looking to Launch in LA Next Year, According to Report', 'unique_id': 231310, 'para': 'It appears that Frieze is headed west. The international art fair is working to launch an edition in Los Angeles in January 2019, according to a report in the newsletter In Other Words . The news comes almost two years after Frieze entered into a strategic partnership with the Hollywood entertainment, sports, and fashion company Endeavor (formerly William Morris Endeavor | IMG). At the time, some speculated that a West Coast expansion might be inevitable considering Endeavor’s roots in LA. Frieze, however, has remained tight-lipped about its plans. A spokesperson for the art fair told artnet News: “We are always exploring new ideas and discussing ways to respond to galleries’ needs but we can’t speak to any specific plans at this point.” He declined to comment further. A representative for Endeavor did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rumors have been circulating for months that Frieze was looking for a director of a new LA fair. But it appears the company has not yet settled on an exact location for the event in the city. The arrival of Frieze in LA would represent a major shift in the art-fair landscape. The city is home to a growing number of collectors and plenty of deep pockets, but it has always proven a tough nut for fairs to crack. In the past seven years alone, a number of local fairs—including Art Platform Los Angeles, Paris Photo Los Angeles, FIAC LA, and Paramount Ranch—have sprung up and then quietly shut down. Although smaller initiatives like Art Los Angeles Contemporary have attracted a dedicated following , the city has never sustained a destination art fair with the agenda-setting pull of Art Basel or Frieze. The launch of Frieze Los Angeles would also represent the first major expansion of the brand since its partnership with Endeavor. Last month, artnet News revealed that Frieze developed, but ultimately abandoned, plans to build a cultural district in the South Bronx. Also last month, Endeavor’s subsidiary IMG announced that it had acquired Exhibitions International, a blockbuster exhibition production company. Frieze currently operates two fairs in London and one in New York. The first London fair launched in 2003. Frieze Masters, an event focused on art made before 2000, and Frieze New York both debuted in 2012. While Frieze’s co-founders Matthew Slotover and Amanda Sharp retain the direction of Frieze, documents show they have minority stake in the brand. Tax records indicate Endeavor is a majority shareholder in Denmark Street Limited, Frieze’s offshore parent company, and controls at least twice as many shares as Sharp and Slotover combined. A Frieze spokesperson said the company does not comment on its finances or the details of its partnership with Endeavor, but that “Matthew and Amanda remain in control of the company and Victoria Siddall is the director of Frieze Art Fairs.” Additional reporting by Eileen Kinsella Follow  on Facebook:', 'author': 'Julia Halperin', 'url': None, 'tags': None, 'captions': None, 'pubtime': datetime.datetime(2018, 2, 1, 0, 0), 'source': 'artnet'}\n",

As reported by the New York Times , the tower, titled Hy-Fi , is the work of New York-based architects the Living . Each year, emerging talents compete to build a temporary structure in the Long Island City institution’s outdoor courtyard. As always, museum visitors will get the opportunity to experience the piece all summer, particularly during “ Warm Up ,” the museum’s popular outdoor concert series. Hy-Fi measures 40 feet fall, with curving cylinders branching out from its base, but what is most remarkable about the project are its building materials. The Living, in collaboration with Ecovative , of Green Island, New York, have developed a special biodegradable brick made of agricultural byproducts, namely chopped up corn stalks, mixed with mycelium mushrooms. Hy-Fi The latter’s living root structure fuse together the biological material, creating a solid object that can serve as a strong, lightweight, weather-resistant building material. The towering pavilion was thoroughly analyzed before it was build in order to make sure that the innovative bricks would be structurally sound. “We can try to do things differently; we don’t have to accept the ways that buildings are always designed,” lead designer David Benjamin said in a video for the Creators Project . Without a doubt, Hy-Fi takes green, sustainable architecture and design to a new level, bringing architecture to life through actual living biological organisms. Hy-Fi At the end of the summer, the structure will be composted. A building that sprang from the earth will return to earth, literally “dust to dust.” The Living’s Hy-Fi will be on view at MoMA PS1 through September 6.

      "{'title': 'Why Pimple Popping Videos Are So Strangely Satisfying', 'unique_id': 148239, 'para': 'This article is about videos of skin conditions being treated. There is some gross stuff here. You have been warned. One of YouTube’s most enduring subcultures is a broad ecosystem of videos described by users and uploaders as “Strangely Satisfying.” This is the haptic side of the site, a constellation of different videos that seek to activate the senses of pleasure-seeking audiences. There’s the ASMR (auto-sensory meridian response) video , which uses gentle sounds to generate a tickling sensation in the viewer. The slime video is a gelatin playground for disembodied hands and fingers. Industrial shredder and hydraulic press videos send iPhones, pineapples, and other unexpected objects through the aforementioned equipment. The “hot knife” video sets a superheated blade to anything you can imagine. Mukbang is a Korean-born cousin of ASMR that swaps whispering for chewing. That’s to say nothing of the “chiropractic adjustment” video, and numerous more that please, tingle, and relax those susceptible to their sway. The pimple popping video is one of the most popular variants of this phenomenon, perhaps because it centers on an act so many of us are familiar with, from adolescence through adulthood. But the most popular pimple popping videos — with colorful names like “Nasty Pimples Gone Wild,”  “Stomach Churning Cyst Is Popped On Mans Face,”  “Extreme Blackheads – Oiliest Skin You’ll Ever See,” and “NASTIEST PIMPLE POP EVER!!!” — are a little more intense than the blemishes we’re used to dealing with in the morning. They vary widely in visual quality, from low-fidelity phone footage of amateur dermatologists putting their unfortunate family members’ zits on display to well-lit recordings of professional medical procedures. They’re filmed everywhere, from suburban kitchens in America to day spas in Vietnam , and probably viewed in as many places as well. Some of them feature cystic acne, which needs to be slit open before pressure is applied, while others showcase minefields of blackheads and “soft pops.” Sometimes the pus comes out smooth, like icing from a pastry bag, while other times it doesn’t want to give. If you’re really lucky, a projectile might fly out and hit the camera, an organic reminder of the layers of glass and electronics between our eyes and what we see. The pimple popping community has received a certain amount of mainstream attention thanks to Dr. Sandra Lee , a dermatologist better known as “Dr. Pimple Popper,” star of the TLC TV series of the same name . Contrary to her moniker, little of Dr. Lee’s show features pimples or popping. She only features the most severe epidermal abnormalities and invasive procedures, true to TLC’s exhibitionist programming prerogative. Unlike her YouTube videos, which show only the surface of the skin and are soundtracked by casual conversation between Lee and her patients, Dr. Pimple Popper spends a lot of time telling the often heart-wrenching life stories of Lee’s most unique clients. The real popping action is reserved for the Dr. Pimple Popper YouTube channel, where so-called “Popaholics” can find a smorgasboard of skin protrusions to watch get taken care of. There are the usual oversized whiteheads and blackheads , as well as lipomas , pilar cysts , calcium deposits , warts , abscesses , rhinophyma , sebaceous filaments , keloids , and other dermal delights. For some, more nauseating than the contents of the videos might be the language Lee uses to describe them. She regularly compares her patients’ cysts and growths to food items, such as cottage cheese, chicken, pinto beans, oranges, egg yolks, and oatmeal. She is perhaps the first person in the pimple popping game who could be considered an auteur — her posts are a far cry from the borderline snuff that constitutes most entries in the genre. Viewers of her “educational videos” (each one features a lengthy disclaimer) can recreate the experience at home with the official Dr. Pimple Popper “Zit Happens” acne spot treatment kit from her digital store. You can even cop a Dr. Pimple Popper Halloween Costume . No matter what Dr. Lee would have us believe, the appeal of pimple popping videos isn’t in their educational value. Like the other varieties of “Strangely Satisfying” fare, the attraction is in their unexpected  activation of our senses. Society considers pimples unsightly, so to find a kind of relaxation not just in images of acne but also in their removal is doubly taboo. The rupture of skin and expulsion of pus produces an eerie kind of stimulation that eludes easy articulation, hence the “strangely” in “strangely satisfying.” It’s not just visual satisfaction that these videos offer, but a feeling of mastery over our own bodies. They allow us to clearly see areas of the body that we normally can’t.

      "{'title': 'Art in Review: Tom Otterness (Published 2002)', 'unique_id': 1375, 'para': '`Free Money and Other Fairy Tales\\'  Marlborough  40 West 57th Street, Manhattan  211 West 19th Street, Chelsea  Through May 18  Tom Otterness may be the world\\'s best public sculptor. That\\'s not such a big claim given the sorry state of public art today. Nevertheless, Mr. Otterness can animate public spaces with amusing pudgy bronze cartoon characters acting out parables of modern life without pandering to either sophisticates or ordinary folks.  Mr. Otterness\\'s gallery exhibitions tend to appear crowded and scattershot. Still, his best works are surprisingly effective metaphorically, emotionally and formally. The centerpiece of the 57th Street part of this show is a 36-foot-long representation of Jonathan Swift\\'s Gulliver. With long tubular legs and a short cylindrical body, he raises his spherical head and gazes unhappily at the Lilliputian figure standing in the palm of his hand and holding the key to his shackles.  In the gallery\\'s outdoor courtyard sits a companion piece, a \"Crying Giant\" composed of similarly simplified geometric elements. That this whimsical tableau works as a touching 9/11 memorial might seem unlikely, but it gets at the childlike feelings of helplessness and grief that so many experienced.  The downtown gallery presents works about money. They are like images for a new version of Monopoly. There is a monumental couple dancing on a bag of money (prerecession stockholders, perhaps); a small seated homeless boy and his dog; a tycoon embezzler under arrest. The best, a sweet 12-foot standing Pooh-like bear — an allusion to a declining stock market, maybe — would look great in Central Park. KEN JOHNSON  Barnaby Furnas  Marianne Boesky Gallery  535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea  Through May 24  Barnaby Furnas offers a dazzling delirium of sex, suicide and war in his impressive first New York solo exhibition.  If you had only Mr. Furnas\\'s cartoonish pictures of a man committing suicide at the beach, his gunshot head splattered against the sky, or of a naked couple making love, their bodies disintegrating and heads exploding, you might call him clever and promising. But in two expansive Civil War battle scenes, he more than fulfills that promise.  These multifigure visions of hand-to-hand combat look something like Saturday morning cartoons on a badly tuned television. Flying bullets leave trails that slice and dice the picture, turning the whole into a patchwork of Cubist fragmentation: bodies go to pieces; blood flies; men kill, scream and die. Confusion reigns, and yet, look closely and you see that it is all as logically choreographed as a 19th-century history painting.  The frenzy of war is reflected in the varieties of form and paint application: Abstract Expressionism, hard-edged geometry and funky illustration turn the surface into a kind of all-over stylistic battlefield. Surface vies with illusory depth, order struggles against chaos.  Together, form and imagery give the impression of a psyche besieged by all its contradictions at once. And yet this crisis is embraced with Nietzschean exuberance. It will be interesting to see where Mr. Furnas goes from here. KEN JOHNSON  `Desiring Machines\\'  `Hans Bellmer and Surrealist Strategies in Contemporary Photography\\'  Dorsky Gallery  11-03 45th Avenue  Long Island City, Queens  Through May 12  This intriguing exhibition sets out to show how Hans Bellmer\\'s creepy photographs of his own bulbous, surrealistic dolls have influenced a number of young female photographers. Organized by Marcello Marvelli and Helaine Posner, the well-orchestrated installation intersperses Bellmer\\'s small, hand-tinted pictures with glossy, often large photographs by Sue de Beer, Anna Gaskell, Deborah Mesa-Pelly and Annika von Hausswolff.  What is most interesting about the conversation between Bellmer and the contemporary women is less the affinities than the differences.  Bellmer (1902-1975) used oblique perspectives, raking light, cropping and fragmentation to animate his ungainly dolls and to hint at narratives involving sadism, pedophilia, rape and murder. The women use similar formal devices to produce enigmatic narratives of personal desire and anxiety. But where Bellmer made the objectified female body a focus of obsessive prurience, the women create scenarios in which actions, events and circumstances are more important.  Ms. Gaskell\\'s image of a girl floating with her head just above water; Ms. de Beer\\'s self-portrait as a pair of interlocked twins; Ms. Mesa-Pelly\\'s picture of a woman holding a red velvet dress over her legs; or Ms. von Hausswolff\\'s feet-first view of a man lying on top of a woman, titled \"The Petrified Couple\" — in all of these works expansive fantasy contrasts sharply with Bellmer\\'s self-gratifying single-mindedness.  The show also includes three small photographs from the 1920\\'s and 30\\'s by the remarkable Claude Cahun. Her small, dreamlike picture of herself sleeping on a shelf in a cupboard is far closer in spirit and form to the works of the contemporary women than anything by Bellmer. KEN JOHNSON  Honoré Sharrer  Spanierman Gallery  45 East 58th Street, Manhattan  Through May 11  Since Honoré Sharrer first won acclaim in the early 1940\\'s for her quirky, superrealist paintings of working people, she has gone her own way in an art world that for years brushed aside the figurative. For more than five decades, her enigmatic canvases have invoked the strange and the weird, laced with a fine edge of wit.  Her art has inevitably drawn the label of magic realism, coined by Alfred H. Barr Jr., the Museum of Modern Art\\'s first director, to describe a precise, realistic technique conveying dreamlike or surreal visions. And in the cleverly colored oils and drawings shown here, going back over four decades, very odd things occur. Lively nudes abound, chairs fly, spoons dance with dishes, birds perch on people.  In short, Ms. Sharrer\\'s work, cued by the colors and the meticulous draftsmanship of Northern Renaissance painting, is full of what she calls non sequiturs — wild juxtapositions of plot and props meant to keep the viewer guessing.  In \"Archer and Unliberated Woman\" (1987) a strapping, pear-shaped woman in a bikini holds out a trophy to a nude male archer, intensely occupied with bow and arrow.  Yet, while spoofy, her paintings can be poignant, as in \"Resurrection of the Waitress\" (1984), in which a buxom flying angel pulls a drowned domestic up to heaven by an eggbeater caught in her hair. And they are fraught with social nuance.  \"A Dream of Monticello\" (1996), informed by revelations about Thomas Jefferson, portrays this elegant founding father closely attended by a grim black servant, as an indifferent white female nude reclines in front of them rigged out with red slippers and a pair of headphones.  In \"Five Men and a Parrot\" (1997), a group of upper-caste men converse in a fancy chamber as a naughty nude woman turns somersaults over their heads and a green parrot eavesdrops on a gilded chair nearby.  Admittedly, this work keeps its distance from current trends or movements. But in this case, vive la distance! GRACE GLUECK  Judith Scott  `Cocoon\\'  Ricco/Maresca  529 West 20th Street, Chelsea  Through tomorrow  Born with Down syndrome, Judith Scott lived with her family until she was 7, when she was institutionalized for 35 years. Twelve years ago, when she was 45, her fraternal twin, Joyce Scott, became her legal guardian and enrolled her in the Creative Growth Art Center in Oakland, Calif., where she lives in a group home.  Ms. Scott began selecting discarded objects — one or a few at a time — and wrapping them in the yarn and string that are abundant at the center, which partly supports itself through the sale of rugs made by its patients.  Seen in Ms. Scott\\'s first, rather overcrowded New York show, the resulting forms are abstract, yet fierce; muffled yet extremely articulate, or articulated. They range from bulky and bulbous to straight and narrow and are often wonderfully animated.  They are also in some way familiar: relatives of a shaman\\'s fetishes or effigies, the sculptures of Franz West and Louise Bourgeois, Jim Lambie\\'s spirit sticks, and certain non-Western art, especially the animal-shaped kono power objects of the Bamana people of Mali, layered and simplified by repeated coatings of organic material. Yet their power doesn\\'t depend on their being placed in an art gallery.  The surfaces of Ms. Scott\\'s pieces present the viewer with an extraordinary range of color combinations and wrapping techniques. The yarn can be spaced closely or widely, obscuring or revealing earlier layers and colors; it can abruptly reverse direction or converge in extensively knotted areas. Sometimes it almost seems stitched, like some kind of rough embroidery or crewel-work.  In a sense, they are rather carefully engineered three-dimensional paintings.  Countering the impression that something has been hidden is the equally strong sense of something turned inside out, and the inescapable impression of a mind and a personality at work creating instances of insistent aesthetic communication. ROBERTA SMITH  Olav Westphalen  Maccarone  45 Canal Street, SoHo  Through May 13  Just before entering Olav Westphalen\\'s exhibition you pass by a grungy bathroom where, it seems, yellow foam has generously overflowed the toilet. Nothing else in Mr. Westphalen\\'s show is so absurdly gross. Indeed, while humor is the main engine of his art, some of his works are quite cerebral.  Two of the very large ink-on-paper works here take off on well-known photographs by Andreas Gursky. One depicts a glowing Prada shoe display minus the shoes. Made carefully in black ink but with lots of dripping, they delightfully spoof Mr. Gursky\\'s pretentious gravitas.  Fearlessly wide-ranging, Mr. Westphalen also offers a news photo-based picture of a room captioned, \"Traitor John Walker is headed to a Virginia prison cell like this one,\" and another documenting the word \"Sorry\" sky-written over the Australian Olympics, a reference to calls for the country to apologize to its aborigines.  Upstairs, there\\'s a video of a performance piece about hockey that\\'s too long and not funny enough, but is imbued with unpretentious good humor.  Mr. Westphalen was born in Germany in 1963, earned an M.F.A. degree in California and now lives in New York. He will have stronger exhibitions in the future, but this one serves as a good introduction to a witty, resourceful and thought-provoking satirist. KEN JOHNSON  `Architecture for One\\'  Five Myles  558 St. Johns Place  Crown Heights, Brooklyn  Through May 11  This exquisite show, organized by Hanna Tierney, treats architecture as an intimate medium, as personal as painting and sculpture.  Marcia Hafif\\'s model for her own home as an enclosure of egg-shaped rooms takes the form of a soft sculpture stitched from white quilted cloth. Stephen Antonakos\\'s dollhouse-size design for a chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas has the palette of a Mondrian painting and is illuminated from within, like a night light.  Other work is more abstract. Si-Yeon Kim\\'s \"Nest,\" made of folded paper, resembles a perfectly proportioned amphitheater, but one with no entrance except overhead. Mia Westerlund Roosen\\'s cagelike ceramic enclosures and Richard Nonas\\'s small two-part wall piece cut from weathered planks come across as fundamentally sculptural, though a walk-in version of one of Ms. Roosen\\'s pieces has been commissioned as a meditation house in India.  Howard McCalebb, who recently produced a strong solo show at Momenta in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, brings sculpture, painting and collage together in two enigmatic, minimalist pieces here. Atim Annette Oton assembles a similar range of media in her \"Black Hair Salon,\" a mockup for a project about the formative social spaces in women\\'s lives.  Her piece, seen in very rough draft form here, will eventually be realized in an interactive digital format, and it couldn\\'t ask for a more auspicious public introduction than at Brooklyn\\'s most distinctively utopian gallery. HOLLAND COTTER  `The Passions of the Good Citizen\\'  Apex Art  291 Church Street, TriBeCa  Through May 11  While organized by different curators, exhibitions at this small nonprofit space often seem cut from the same dry, cerebral fabric. \"The Passions of the Good Citizen\" offers a higher quotient of visual juice, yet holds together conceptually. It has been organized by Heather Felty, the director of Apex, who has probably studied its exhibitions longer than anyone.  The show examines the complementary rites of buying and selling. Attractive narcissistic women abound in the unchanging smiling face of Claude Closky\\'s video \"Hello and Welcome\" and in Carey Young\\'s video \"Everything You\\'ve Heard Is Wrong,\" in which a young businesswoman lectures the crowds at Hyde Park Corner in London, the epicenter of soapboxes, on effective public speaking. Jenny Holzer\\'s most famous aphorism, \"Protect Me From What I Want,\" looms over Times Square in a photograph, and seems a fitting mantra for the dozens of young aspiring models in Juergen Teller\\'s \"Go-Sees\" snapshots.  Michael Bevilacqua portrays a candy-colored landscape, overseen by a young woman, invaded by advertising logos. Ester Partegàs dots one wall with large trompe-l\\'oeil replicas of shopping receipts that upon examination include the shopper\\'s rationales for spending money.  Kristin Lucas\\'s soulful cross-wired videos offer the most critical concept of good citizenship, creating a complex, borderless electronic space that poetically encompasses both the wonders and dangers of the digital age. Made between 1994 and 2000, they seem better, and more prescient, than ever. ROBERTA SMITH  Sue Williams  303 Gallery  525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea  Through May 18  Sue Williams\\'s gradual evolution — from a raunchy calligraphic art incorporating angry, erotic images of body parts to a milder, more painterly but still sexy abstraction of looping, sweeping brush strokes — has been much applauded. But her older work is more of a challenge.  From her networks of meandering black lines that make explicit references to penises, orifices, brutal sex play and unspeakable acts, she has turned to a new, de Kooningesque concept: fat, ribbony sweeps and snarls in bright colors, often dripping with paint, that curl and caper with acrobatic abandon on bare white grounds. Abstract and uninflected though they are, they can still be read as making bodily and sexual allusions.  But this show also includes a group of the more explicit black-and-whites, among them a suggestively positioned woman\\'s lower body, a lone clitoris with the frills of an old-fashioned valentine, what appear to be fragments of pelvic innards or flower parts, and a few scenarios in which puffy undefinable things that go bump in the night cavort in orgiastic revels.  It is these tougher linear scenarios — now freer, more playful and graceful in execution — that despite the sensual allure of her ribbony brush strokes are still the best of Ms. Williams\\'s work.

      "{'title': 'The Corrupt World of Then, So Similar to Now (Published 2013)', 'unique_id': 83659, 'para': '“Last Tango in Berlin,” the title of Ute Lemper’s, dense, fiery new show at 54 Below, refers to the disappearance of European cabaret traditions under the relentless onslaught of pop. Berlin may be the cultural capital of Europe, observed Ms. Lemper, who was born in Germany in 1963, but today it is “almost without any memory.” Genres like the caustic, cynical cabaret of Germany’s Weimar period and the more romantic French chanson are all but forgotten. The linchpin of “Last Tango in Berlin” is Brecht-Weill’s “Threepenny Opera,” whose musical themes bubble up again and again. First produced to wild acclaim in 1928, this satirical vision of society as a corrupt underworld of criminals, beggars and prostitutes is as pertinent today as it ever was, Ms. Lemper suggested. Bertolt Brecht’s question — who is a bigger criminal, a bank owner or a bank robber? — applies directly to the world of Bernie Madoff and predatory institutions that are too big to fail. What was then is now. “Last Tango in Berlin” is a stream of consciousness in several languages, mostly German, French and English, in which Ms. Lemper interweaves songs, song fragments, personal reminiscences and social commentary into an impressionistic historical tapestry. Wearing a gleaming black cocktail dress, her eyes narrowed to slits, her sleek blonde head thrown back, she embodies the Marlene Dietrich archetype of a forbidding continental temptress who has seen it all. This coldly sexy character has no illusions about men. If the world’s “Jimmies, Johnnies, Joeys and Peters,” in her words, are faithless, treacherous users of women, she is masochistically addicted to the charms of the kind of rogue excoriated in Brecht-Weill’s “Surabaya Johnny,” which in her interpretation faded into a desperate whisper. Ms. Lemper can be fiercely intimidating, and her aggressive willfulness is easily mistaken for European cultural snobbery. She forcefully reminds you of how little you know about music beyond the borders of the United States. “The Threepenny Opera” was the starting and ending place in a show whose early section focused on tango music played by Vana Gierig on piano and Tito Castro on bandoneon. Their heady jazz-inflected arrangements reinforced the connection of European cabaret to the Argentine tango music composed by Astor Piazzolla. Ms. Lemper was most approachable when she retracted her sharp vocal claws to strike a reflective stance.

      "{'title': 'Maria Taniguchi Announced as Winner of Hugo Boss Asia Art 2015', 'unique_id': 230564, 'para': 'The winner of Hugo Boss Asia Art 2015 award is Maria Taniguchi, as announced in a ceremony at the Rockbund Art Museum (RAM) last night. Taniguchi is the recipient of a ¥300,000 ($46,948) stipend, which will go towards developing her practice. “With the precious contribution of the Hugo Boss Asia Art 2015 jury members, we are extremely proud to award the female artist Maria Taniguchi from Manila, Philippines,” Larys Frogier, chair of the Hugo Boss Asia Art jury and director of RAM, said in a statement. “Her very singular, humble, but extremely focused practice of painting and video enriched the realm of media and raised a unique sensitivity of making the picture with infinite possibilities of meaning,” he added. There was much speculation about the relatively new award leading up to the announcement, with Moe Satt tipped as a front-runner . Satt was just one of six nominees for the prize which is intended to support young artists from China and South-East Asia at the beginning of their careers. Taniguchi was born in 1981 in Dumaguete, Philippines, and lives and works in Manila. Through her voluminous brick paintings, sculptures, and videos, Taniguchi tirelessly explores the possibilities of form via a strong investment of both time and labor. In her work, the artist reflects the experience of living amid the socio-political situation and economic structure of the Philippines. “[Taniguchi’s] never ending development of brick paintings engages subtle dialogues and blurs the frontiers with sculpture, architecture, installation, offering the spectators a powerful experience of the physical, the geo-political and the mental limitations/extensions of the inside-out space/time representations,” Frogier explained. “Her detailed video compositions of objects, architectonic elements, and color spectrums turn out the repetition and the familiar into a full practice of difference and strangeness. Maria Taniguchi solidly positions her work, without any compromise, into the context of Asia and international contemporary art,” he added. An exhibition of works by Taniguchi and the five other nominees—Guan Xiao, Huang Po-Chih, Moe Satt, Vandy Rattana, and Yang Xinguang—is currently on view at the “Hugo Boss Asia Art 2015” exhibition at RAM. This prize for emerging Asian artists boasts an impressive jury including Hou Hanru, artistic director of MAXXI in Rome, super-collector Patrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo , and Li Qi, senior curator at the Rockbund Art Museum. Taniguchi is the second winner of the biennial award. The winner of the 2013 award was Hong Kong-based artist Kwan Sheung Chi. “Hugo Boss Asia Art 2015” is on view at RAM from October 30, 2015 – January 3, 2016.

      "{'title': 'How ‘The Queen’s Gambit’ Started a New Debate About Sexism in Chess', 'unique_id': 11706, 'para': 'Judit Polgar might be the one woman in the world who knows how Beth, the heroine of the hit Netflix series “ The Queen’s Gambit, ” really feels. Like Beth, Polgar, who is from Hungary, stood out during her career because she regularly beat the world’s top players, including Garry Kasparov in 2002, when he was ranked No. 1. Polgar, the only woman to ever be ranked in the Top 10 or to play for the overall world championship, retired from competitive chess in 2014. Watching the series, which she described as an “incredible performance,” gave her a sense of déjà vu, particularly in the later episodes. But there was one respect in which she could not identify with Beth’s experience: how the male competitors treated her. “They were too nice to her,” Polgar said. When she was proving herself and rising in the world rankings, Polgar said the men often made disparaging comments about her ability and sometimes jokes, which they thought were funny but were actually hurtful. And no one ever resigned to her as Shapkin did to Beth in Episode 7 by gallantly holding her hand near his lips. “There were opponents who refused to shake hands,” she recalled. “There was one who hit his head on the board after he lost.” Not every woman has had negative experiences. Irina Krush , who won her eighth United States Women’s Championship last month, said that she felt as if the chess community and men in particular were very supportive of her when she was an up-and-coming player. She said of the series, “The spirit of what they are showing conforms to my experience.” Whether what happens to Beth is typical or not, the popularity of “ The Queen’s Gambit ” has inspired anew a debate about inequality and sexism in chess and what, if anything, can be done about them. Though chess would seem like one area where men and women should be able to compete on equal footing, historically, very few women have been able to do so. Among the more than 1,700 regular grandmasters worldwide, only 37, including Polgar and Krush, are women. Currently, only one woman, Hou Yifan of China, ranks in the Top 100, at No. 88 , and she has been playing infrequently, even before the pandemic. The superiority of men in the game is so well established that the best female players have freely acknowledged it. In a recent issue of Mint, in an article titled, “ Why Women Lose at Chess ,” Koneru Humpy, an Indian player currently ranked No. 3 among women , said that men are just better players. “It’s proven,” she said. “You have to accept it.” The dearth of women at the top of the game is one reason that there are separate tournaments for women, including a world championship; the World Chess Federation even created titles for women, such as women grandmaster. Having such institutionalized, second-class status might seem like a bad idea, but not according to Anastasiya Karlovich, a woman grandmaster who was the press officer for the World Chess Federation for several years. She said that the women’s titles permit more female players to earn a living as professionals, thereby increasing their participation in the game. Karlovich said that the Netflix show has helped her indirectly: It has made the parents of her chess students look at her differently. “They have more respect for me. They understand better the life of a player,” she said. While some men have speculated that the reason there are so few top female players is because they are not wired for it — Kasparov once said that it is not in their nature — women think the overriding reason is cultural expectations and bias. Polgar said that society and even parents can undermine their daughters’ efforts to improve, though, in her case, her parents, in particular her father, did the opposite: They started teaching her chess when she was of kindergarten age. Polgar also has two older sisters, Susan, who became a grandmaster and women’s world champion, and Sofia, who became an international master, to blaze the way and support her. Elizabeth Spiegel is an expert, a level just below master, and has taught chess for two decades at I.S. 318, a public middle school in Brooklyn that has won dozens of national championships . She believes that cultural stereotypes definitely affect how people learn and play chess. She noted that boys tend to be overconfident, but that is more of a strength than a flaw in chess. On the other hand, during class, when girls answer her questions, they often begin, “I think I am wrong, but …” Krush said that the cultural cleaving between boys and girls happens at a young age. Scrolling through the lists of the top players in the United States who are 7, 8 and 9, Krush pointed out there are only a small handful of girls in the Top 10. That creates and reinforces another problem that discourages women’s participation: too few social contacts. Jennifer Shahade, a two-time U.S. Women’s Champion who has written two books about women in chess (“Chess Bitch” and “Play Like a Girl!”) and is the women’s program director at the U.S. Chess Federation, said teenage girls tend to stop playing chess because there are so few of them and they want the social support. That Beth is a loner is likely an important reason she does not quit playing in tournaments. Shahade said she actually did quit for a while, at about age 12, even though she came from a chess family. Her father, Mike, was a master and her brother, Greg, became an international master. “I was self-conscious,” Shahade said. “My brother was super talented and had become a master so early and so easily. I was a much slower learner.” Shahade, who grew up admiring Polgar, said it was “totally inspiring” to see Beth’s story unfold. Like Beth, who loses all her games to Benny the first time they play speed chess, she prefers slow, or classical, chess. Of 74,000 members in total, the U.S. Chess Federation said it has about 10,500 female members. Shahade wants to increase that number, as well as their participation. To that end, Shahade and the federation started an online chess club in April to keep female players engaged during the pandemic. In the last few weeks, there have been between 80 and 140 participants, with quite a few older players. The last meeting also had a special guest: Kasparov, who has become a big booster of women’s chess since his retirement from competition in 2005. He was also a consultant on the Netflix series. To keep the momentum going, Shahade is launching a new online group called the “Madwoman’s Book Club.” The title refers to a pejorative name used for the queen in the 15th and 16th centuries after it became the most powerful piece on the board. The first meeting this Friday already has 100 people signed up.

Always the left one. If it slips off, the chain catches it.  My wife gave it to me as a present 15 years ago. It started with me not being able to read and fill out check-in forms at hotels. I chose a monocle over glasses because it’s more practical. I can have it in front of my eye in an instant and don’t need to fiddle with a glasses case first.  Of course the monocle isn’t for reading books for an extended period of time. It’s meant for quick use: for glancing at one’s mobile phone, for skimming over a letter. A monocle can be helpful if you’re standing at someone’s door and need to quickly decipher the names beside the doorbell, or if you are holding a movie ticket or a map of a city. Or if you’re at a museum and want to read the wall texts beside the paintings. So it has all sorts of applications in buildings, in rooms – great!  I would never switch to glasses. Plus, no one has a monocle these days. They’re a thing of the past.

      "{'title': 'How Museums Are Combatting a Shortage of East Asian Art Conservators', 'unique_id': 123627, 'para': 'Beginning around the 7th century, artists in East Asia worked with elaborate painting techniques and materials unlike any others used in the history of art. Early Japanese, Chinese, and Korean artists painted on thin sheets of silk or paper, using pigments of carbon-based inks, mineral colors, and vegetable dyes particular to their geographical regions. They framed paintings with mounting silks, which were bonded together by layers of backing paper. They displayed their delicate works using hand scrolls or hanging scrolls with roller bars affixed to each end. Because early East Asian art is made of such specific materials, its upkeep requires specially trained conservators. While American collections of East Asian paintings have grown tremendously in the past several centuries, the conservation laboratories dedicated to maintaining these collections have not. The crisis in conservation of East Asian paintings became evident about a decade ago. All the conservators in the field were approaching retirement, and there were no identifiable up-and-coming practitioners to fill their hyper-specialized positions. In 2012, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation arranged a meeting with the major American collections of Chinese paintings to discuss how to prevent the breakdown of these invaluable art objects. The response to this meeting was unprecedented in the conservation field. In 2018, the Cleveland Museum of Art (CMA) established the Center for Chinese Painting Conservation, which will train Chinese painting conservation fellows starting next year with funding from the Mellon Foundation and a matching gift of $1.5 million from June and Simon K.C. Li. After the preservation of CMA’s permanent collection, the Center will help restore objects from other museums’ Asian art collections as a service to the field and as training for their resident fellows. The Freer | Sackler, Museum of Fine Arts Boston and The Metropolitan Museum of Art are also expanding their teams of East Asian painting conservators by offering fellowships endowed by The Mellon Foundation, matching grants or private aid. A new Japanese painting fellow started working at the Freer | Sackler last week, funded by the Hirayama Program. The search for a new Mellon Chinese painting conservator will begin this fall to replace the current fellow leaving in May. The MFA Boston has secured conservators through Mellon for over five years. This is the second year for The Met’s Chinese painting fellow position, sponsored by Mellon and a matching grant. “It’s a huge investment,” Dr. Maxwell Hearn, The Met’s Chairman of Asian Art, told Hyperallergic. “The space, personnel, materials, and expertise alone are hard to sustain. The tradition of Asian painting conservation is an artisan-like craft you learn through apprenticeship, which is not an easy system to maintain. We, the older conservation studios in American museums, have historically relied on bringing talent from Asia.” The presence of only one US-born conservator of Chinese paintings in the field, Grace Jan, currently at the Freer | Sackler, underscores that point. Training for East Asian painting conservation is daunting for American students. There are currently four conservation graduate programs in the US that require three to four years of training. A student with appropriate language fluency may enter a 10-year apprenticeship program at a studio in Japan, China, or Korea. In addition to teaching traditional conservation methods, American training centers must acquire supplies from silk weavers and traditional paper makers, most of whom are based in Asia. These Asian supply chains are made up of “small cottage industries carried out by generation by generation in the country of origin,” Dr. Hearn says. He predicts that the West will always rely on Asia for the essential papers, silks, mounting brocades, and even brushes and tools: “We are beholden to how these crafts are sustained in Korea, China and Japan.” Cleveland’s Center for Chinese Painting Conservation plans to send its fellows to meet suppliers in China, accompanied by museum’s current conservator, Yi-Hsia Hsaio. What about museums that have collections of Chinese, Japanese or Korean paintings but don’t have a specialist trained to conserve them? “Some museums will send paintings to conservators working privately, which, frankly, there are very few,” says Andrew Hare, supervisory East Asian conservator for the Freer | Sackler. “Some will send them to Korea, China, or Japan for treatment. Some will have conservators with basic training apply a remedial treatment.” It was that response and a meeting with The Mellon Foundation that inspired the Seattle Art Museum (SAM) to establish an Asian painting conservation center after securing a $3.5m Mellon grant in 2017. Seattle’s chief conservator, Nick Dorman, told Hyperallergic the museum is currently looking for two Japanese conservators, one with mounting expertise — which could prove difficult, given the scarcity of conservators with adequate training. Unlike The Met, MFA Boston, Cleveland, and Freer, Seattle’s primary interest is in treating objects that belong to other museum collections. Bringing curators, conservators, and paintings into the same studio instead of sending an art object abroad for treatment enables deeper conversations about how to approach restoration. “Our curators are responsible for the aesthetic appearance of the object,” Dr. Hearn notes. “For example, it is up to them to weigh in on a color of a silk mounting that accompanies a work of art. Typically, our conservators would help the curator by creating various dye samples and presenting them next to the painting. The intimate relationship between curator and conservator is important.” The fruits of such relationships are on view at the recently opened Freer | Sackler exhibition, Empresses of China’s Forbidden City, 1644-1912. When very large paintings arrived from Beijing without traditional mounts, Freer conservators and curators collaborated with Palace Museum conservators to produce innovative display methods. In 2014, CMA hosted all the US-based East Asian art conservators under one roof for the first time ever. This summer, that network of practitioners will meet again at The Met to compare findings and share resources. The ultimate test of these investments and interventions will come when one generation of conservators retires and the next generation comes up, notes Hare: “Then we will get a sense of where we really are.”', 'author': 'Kealey Boyd', 'url': None, 'tags': None, 'captions': ['Tanya Uyeda, Associate Conservator in Asian Conservation and Philip Meredith, Higashiyama Kaii Conservator of Japanese Paintings (image courtesy the Museum of Fine Arts Boston)', 'Conservator Pinfang Zhu training Yi-Hsia Hsiao with an ancestor portrait (image courtesy the Cleveland Museum of Art)', 'Chinese conservator Xiangmei Gu and Japanese conservator Jiro Ueda work together to line a large painting while Mellon fellow Zhichao Lyu observes (image courtesy the Freer | Sackler)', 'Tanya Uyeda, Associate Conservator in Asian Conservation and Philip Meredith, Higashiyama Kaii Conservator of Japanese Paintings (image courtesy the Museum of Fine Arts Boston)', 'Two conservators carefully remove the paper lining from the back of a Buddhist painting on silk (image courtesy the Freer | Sackler)', 'Asian Painting Conservation Studio in development at the Seattle Asian Art Museum (image rendering courtesy of LMN Architects and Seattle Art Museum)'], 'pubtime': datetime.datetime(2019, 4, 8, 0, 0), 'source': 'Hyperallergic'}\n",

He was 75. The Associated Press reported that Mr. Heller’s cousin, Gary Ballen, said he died in a hospital after he had a heart attack while driving. Mr. Heller and Eric Wright, the rapper known as Eazy-E , founded Ruthless Records in 1987. A year later, the label released “Straight Outta Compton,” the debut album by the rap group N.W.A, whose members, in addition to Eazy-E, were Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, soon to become major figures in hip-hop, as well as DJ Yella and MC Ren. The album was a hit and helped propel West Coast gangsta rap into the national spotlight — and into the center of controversy. Some people said the lyrics of N.W.A and other gangsta rappers glorified violence, while others said they simply reflected the reality of black urban life. N.W.A’s success was short-lived. Ice Cube left in 1989, and the group, which Mr. Heller managed, broke up in 1991 amid accusations of mismanagement. Mr. Heller remained close to Eazy-E, but Dr. Dre and Ice Cube criticized Mr. Heller publicly. The acrimony did not go away. Speaking to The New York Times in April, Ice Cube accused Mr. Heller of “participating in the destruction” of N.W.A and claimed that he had “little or nothing to do with” the group’s music, adding, “We would never listen to his ideas.” “Straight Outta Compton,” F. Gary Gray’s well-received 2015 film about N.W.A, also presented Mr. Heller, who was played by Paul Giamatti, in a harshly negative light. Mr. Heller complained that he was depicted as “the ‘bad guy’ in the movie who is solely responsible for the demise of N.W.A” and who withheld money from the group. He sued NBC Universal, which released the movie, and more than a dozen others associated with it for defamation, seeking $35 million in actual damages and $75 million in punitive damages. A judge dismissed most of the lawsuit in June. Mr. Ballen told The Associated Press that the litigation had caused Mr. Heller significant stress. Mr. Heller started his music career in the 1960s as an agent and promoter, working with Pink Floyd, Marvin Gaye, Creedence Clearwater Revival and other major rock and R&B acts. He set up Elton John’s first performance in the United States, Mr. Ballen told The Associated Press. He was living with his parents after a period of financial trouble when he began working with Eazy-E. Recalling Mr. Heller’s excitement when he heard a cassette recording of N.W.A’s early work, Mr. Ballen said: “As far as I’m concerned, there would never be a Dr. Dre or an Ice Cube if it wasn’t for Jerry getting their first deal, which was really difficult. Nobody wanted to sign them.” In 2001, Mr. Heller told The Los Angeles Times that he considered gangsta rap “the most important movement since the beginning of rock ’n’ roll.” Mr. Heller’s later music-business ventures included a label specializing in Latino hip-hop performers, but he never again achieved the level of success he had with Ruthless Records. In an interview with the website Grantland in 2015 , he said that “of all the things that I’ve done, certainly the most important period of my life” was the years he worked with Eazy-E, adding, “That was the period I’m most proud of.” Eazy-E died from complications of AIDS in 1995. This year N.W.A was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which called the group “the most controversial and complicated voices of their generation.” Gerald Heller was born on Oct. 6, 1940, and raised in Cleveland. He said he faced strong anti-Semitism growing up and that his father, the owner of a scrap metal business, spent time with the Jewish mob, Billboard magazine reported . He served in the Army and earned a business degree from the University of Southern California after he was discharged.

But, as compensation, there’s Mr. Tennant, biting the daily apple packed for him by his wife (Ashley Jensen of “Ugly Betty”) with a relish most of us could barely muster for a Peter Luger steak. There’s also the newly minted Tony winner Sophie Okonedo , in her most imperious mode as a rival barrister. Toby Kebbell (“Wrath of the Titans”) is effective as Liam, the suspected killer. Technically speaking, Liam is a suspect in several murders, each of which entails a trial whose result illustrates the show’s extremely hazy ideas about moral choices and emphasis on work over family. We know he’s guilty, however, because he keeps a room in his house filled with birds in cages. Also because every time we see him in a prison cell, he’s doing high-degree-of-difficulty push-ups. David Wolstencroft, who created and wrote the show, likes jolts but not surprises; everything in “The Escape Artist” is predictable, except for the things that just don’t make sense. Why blithely return to the rural cottage where you’ve just been freaked out by an intruder? Why make a big issue of whether a child can identify a murderer, and then when the child starts talking about what he saw, neglect to mention whether he can identify the murderer? Never mind. Fans of Mr. Tennant certainly won’t. (Though fans of British mysteries who have watched the BBC legal drama “ Silk ” may be startled by some of the similarities between the two shows.) In the final hour, Will gets the revenge we know he’s going to get — that’s a spoiler, but only a crime-potboiler virgin won’t see it coming — and he gets it in a fairly entertaining if harebrained fashion.

With her new work she forsakes her tributes to the glazed ceramic sculptures of dignified court ladies from the Tang dynasty -- which she made in wood with a chain saw and casually painted -- and is looking to European puppetry. At least human size, these figures have wood heads and hands and clothed bodies; they hang from the ceiling and manage to be both monumental and weightless. The best is ''Bestial,'' a large, bearlike creature whose pear-shaped body is defined by a grid of squares made of grisaille-toned fabric wired together like a crude quilt facing. The garments on the other figures, which include a sitting Madonna-like woman, a masked bandit and ''The Puppeteer,'' are not as engaging or sculpturally articulated, although the puppeteer's coat is tufted with sprouts of bright yarn. Next to him is a small mountain made of embroidered fabric on a frame -- a bit of puppet-show set design that has the vibrant roughness of Ms. Chu's Tang ladies and suggests further experiments in the textile arts. In the back gallery, ''El Primo'' attests to Ms. Chu's continued skill with wood. It further heroicizes one of Velázquez's dwarfs by placing him on a high pedestal: the figure, carved from a block of laminated wood, has in places been chain-sawed down to nothingness. This results in a forlorn, ethereal monument through which you can almost see light.

      "{'title': 'A Rapper’s Still Stirring Things Up by Being Laid-Back (Published 2011)', 'unique_id': 62415, 'para': 'Very early on Thursday morning at the Blue Note, Rakim told a story about going to the house of the producer Marley Marl in the mid-1980s to record a song. Once there, he took the microphone and promptly sat on the couch. Marley Marl, he remembered, became agitated and suggested that he stand up to give the track more energy. Rakim demurred. That low-energy hum? “That’s how I wanna sound.” Later, after he’d released some songs, Rakim saw Marley Marl, who exclaimed, he said, “Now we see what you was doing!” What he was doing was “Paid In Full” (4th & B’way/Island), the debut by Eric B. & Rakim, which became one of the most influential hip-hop albums of the 1980s. At this concert — the second of two sets — Rakim, accompanied by the Roots, was revisiting the album in celebration of its 25th anniversary. (Loosely defined: the album was released in 1987, though its first single was released in 1986.) It was part of the first Blue Note Jazz Festival, though the Roots, hip-hop educators as much as entertainers, rarely need an occasion for such didacticism. By today’s measurements, “Paid In Full” sounds tiny, a Spartan album full of rapping about rapping, rapping about the music, rapping about listening to the music, rapping about the dancers dancing to the music. During this show one of the album’s less heralded songs, “As the Rhyme Goes On,” was a highlight: If you just keep kicking Listen to the mix and think You’ll sink into the rhyme like quicksand Holds and controls you till I leave You fall deeper in the style It’s hard to breathe No rapper has had a heavier center of gravity than Rakim, his voice tough and sinewy, his cadence hard with declarative force. Here he happily ceded some of that authority to Black Thought, the rapper for the Roots, who took on about half the verses, and to the boisterous crowd, who often took over on the punchiest lines: “Thought I was a doughnut/she tried to glaze me!” For about an hour the Roots made this barebones album sound orchestral, thanks to Questlove’s impeccable drumming; the fatty basslines by the tuba player Damon Bryson on the title track and “Move the Crowd”; the quick guitar work of Kirk Douglas on “I Know You Got Soul”; and the signature “Chinese Arithmetic” chords plinked out by the keyboardist James Poyser. Rakim may not have the vocal depth he once did, but he was still formidable, even when backing up Black Thought or gleefully remembering acting out at parties as a child when told he was too small to rap: “There’s a lot of D.J.s in Long Island with holes in their speakers.” Before the final song, “Microphone Fiend” — from the second Eric B. & Rakim album, “Follow the Leader” — Rakim took the microphone to his inner forearm.

      "{'title': 'No Kidding: Fairy Dust Can Swing Super Bowl (Published 2012)', 'unique_id': 13521, 'para': 'YOU’VE heard, perhaps, there’s a football game Sunday evening? On television from Indianapolis? New York Giants vs. New England Patriots? A lot of betting on it? Well, here’s a spoiler: The Giants win. I’m not kidding. This is no prediction based on an intricate analysis of matchups and tendencies. Nor is it a breast-beating declaration by a rip-snorting athlete daring fate and the disrespected opposition to prove him wrong. It’s the truth. The Giants have the fairy dust. I know many football fans — mostly Patriots fans — will scoff. They will argue that the New England quarterback, Tom Brady, inarguably one of the greats of the game, will expertly dissect a suspect Giants secondary, especially if the Giants don’t muster a potent pass rush. They will argue that the Pats’ tight ends, Rob Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez, with their size and speed, are uncoverable, and that Wes Welker, the water bug of a receiver, will keep moving the chains on third down. That will keep the Giants’ offense off the field and minimize the exposure of a Patriots defense that gave up more yards than every team but one this year. You can’t argue with these people. They believe in the lessons of history and demonstrable facts. But I know there are many of you out there, nonfans who will watch the Super Bowl this weekend, dragged to the television by a significant other; by the prospect of excellent food and company at a party; by Madonna, who will sing at halftime; or simply by the annual spectacle that the game has become. You know who you are. You have to watch the Super Bowl just as you have to watch the Oscars. For you game analysis is futile; there’s too much to catch up on, and you’re not that interested, right? So trust me; here’s all you need to know. A much misunderstood (and often altogether ignored) element of professional sports, fairy dust is an intermittently appearing force of nature — like, say, those swarms of cicadas that now and then overwhelm wheat fields. You can’t see it coming, but you can see the results. It gets sprinkled invisibly on a floundering, splintered team, which overnight coalesces into an efficient machine. Amazingly, at the same time, its opponents begin to squander opportunities and make dunderheaded moves; the ball begins to bounce fortuitously; and the officials start seeing the game through fairy-dust-clouded eyes. Thus are determined the outcomes of pennant races, the N.B.A. playoffs or the Super Bowl. The Miracle Mets of 1969? The miracle on ice that brought the United States Olympic hockey team of 1980 the gold medal? No miracles. Fairy dust: potent, ultimately decisive stuff, which is why, by the way, Tim Tebow’s difficult-to-explain victory streak this season was not attributable to fairy dust. (Divine intervention, some would say, though if so, it’s evidently not overly powerful; after all, Tebow’s Broncos were clobbered by the Patriots.) A month and a half ago the Giants were mediocre. Well, no. They stank. They’d lost five of their previous six games, including an especially listless performance against the woeful Redskins, during which their best receiver, Hakeem Nicks, had a sure touchdown pass bounce off his face mask. Their running attack was the worst in the league — the worst! The defensive backfield appeared clueless as opposing receivers wandered in solitude all over the field. Then? Fairy dust. First of all, the Giants suddenly played with a previously lacking coordination, like athletes who were actually acquainted with one another. A couple of guys returned from injuries. But they beat the Jets after a routine short pass out of the end zone by the Giants quarterback, Eli Manning, turned into a 99-yard touchdown as two Jet defenders seemed to step aside and let the receiver, Victor Cruz, speed down the sideline to the end zone. They beat the Cowboys after twice fumbling the ball, only to have a Cowboy fumble the fumble each time and allow the Giants to get it back. When the Cowboys did recover a third Giant fumble, a penalty nullified the play. They beat the Packers when Nicks caught two long touchdown passes, including a Hail Mary heave from Manning just before the half — which is proof of fairy dust all by itself. They beat the 49ers with the aid of an injury. Ted Ginn Jr., the 49ers’ dangerous kick returner, was out, and the Giants scored their final 10 points in a 20-17 victory when his replacement, Kyle Williams, muffed two punts. In the same game a seeming Giants fumble was undone on a close call by the officials, who ruled the play was over before the ball came loose. And what seemed like a sure Manning interception didn’t materialize because two 49ers collided as they reached for the ball. One more thing. We are currently experiencing a rare, perhaps unique, sports cycle in which fairy dust is being sprinkled with eyebrow-raising regularity. Last June the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association got a dose, unexpectedly dispatching the Los Angeles Lakers and the Miami Heat en route to the championship. And in the fall the St. Louis Cardinals became, in the words of Jayson Stark of ESPN.com, “the most improbable World Series champions who ever lived.” In September the Cardinals were 10 ½ games out of first place with 31 games to play, and squeaked into the playoffs on the last day. Seemingly the weakest of the eight teams to make the playoffs, they nonetheless advanced to the World Series against the Texas Rangers and twice came within a strike of losing it before finally triumphing. Fairy dust is in the air, my friends. Forget Brady vs. Manning. Forget Gronkowski’s sore ankle. Forget Cruz’s end zone salsa dance. Forget the idea that the Patriots receiver Chad Ochocinco will make an unlikely impact on the game. All you have to know as you sink into your sofa and tune in is this: The Giants have the fairy dust, and Giants fans — like me — are sniffing it.', 'author': 'Bruce Weber', 'url': ['https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/03/arts/television/a-nonfans-guide-to-the-key-to-the-super-bowl.html'], 'tags': None, 'captions': None, 'pubtime': datetime.datetime(2012, 2, 2, 0, 0), 'source': 'Nytimes_Arts'}\n",
      "{'title': 'A Stroll Through a Forest of Ribbons That Simulates Synesthesia', 'unique_id': 149692, 'para': 'SARASOTA, Fla. — Most people have heard of synesthesia, a cognitive condition that causes the synesthete to conflate one sense for another, for example to taste colors, or perceive certain letters to light up or have personalities. But it occurred to me, as I stepped into the exhibition space for Pathless Woods , an installation work by synesthetic artist Anne Patterson at the Ringling Museum of Art , that I had always held an abstracted view of what a synesthetic experience might feel like, and never formalized those thoughts in any concrete manner. The good news is that Patterson has done the job for us, and quite a nice one of it at that, with an installation specifically built for the space at the Ringling. Pathless Woods is simple in its component parts: light, sound, and about 24 miles of ribbon in various colors. The ribbons are hung from the ceiling in a dense grid with fields of hot reds and pinks meshing and contrasting with areas of green, blue, and purple. Video projections by Adam Larsen throw branches, falling rain, and rushing water against the ephemeral and changing scrim of ribbons, while the air is permeated by scents concocted by artist Beau Rhee. The whole scene is soundtracked with composer Michael Gandolfi ’s lively orchestral work “The Garden of Cosmic Speculation.” With frequent mood changes, sometimes quiet, and sometimes punctuated by bright horns, it helps invoke in the visitor a version of Patterson’s synesthetic gifts, which happen largely in response to musical stimuli. “When I hear music I see color and shape,” she said in an email interview with Hyperallergic. “I use this gift a lot with my work. In the case of [ Pathless Woods ] I listened to the music, and specific sections triggered for me the colors I used in the piece. I also responded to the music by letting it guide me in picking the projected images that are inside the ribbons.” Patterson also experiences synesthesia in connection with numbers, seeing them as personified, with genders, personalities, and even clothing. “Very weird, I know,” she said. The resulting feast for the senses is completed with touch, as viewers are invited to enter the space and wander through the field of ribbons by any path they see fit. The room is darkened, with the brightest point being a kind of circular clearing in the midst of the piece, surrounded by red ribbons. The color-coding and density of the ribbons correlate to emotional states. “The dark greens and purples on the left of the piece align with the emotionally darker parts of the music,” said Patterson. “The reds are the heart of the piece — that is also why the thickest ribbons are in the red section. The blues and bright greens on the right feel very joyous and energy-filled to me. It is as if we go through the dark places and into the heart to come out into the light.” The work’s title is perhaps in reference to a poem by Lord George Gordon Byron, “Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage,” the opening line of which reads: “There is a pleasure in the pathless woods.” There is, indeed, much pleasure to be taken in Patterson’s installation, and with the musical accompaniment on a roughly 20-minute loop, no need to hurry the journey. The combination of sensory experiences manages to very closely suggest a walk through the woods, despite having none of the literal characteristics of the outdoors. Ribbons act as gentle proxies for vegetation, brushing against you at close range and standing static from afar; the projections simulate weather and shifting sunlight through the leaves; and the music gives a strong impression of the majesty of nature in sonic form. The general darkness of the environment manifests an effect akin to driving through dense fog — you can only see things as you come directly upon them, including other visitors to the piece, which occasions mysterious encounters in this forest of ribbons. Pathless Woods is the product of community efforts, with 740 hours of labor by a group of volunteers under Patterson’s supervision (one imagine the Ringling assiduously harnessed the power of its surrounding retirement-age community). The artist remained hands-on throughout the process, affording volunteers as well as viewers the opportunity to make tactile connection with the work.  “It was like a swing circle or a cooking group,” said Patterson. “We were all using our hands at the same time in the same way to create a beautiful piece of art. I do love the fact that the viewer gets to feel the ribbons brushing up on their arms and shoulders in a way that is similar to the feeling those of us had in our hands as we cut, rolled, and tied the ribbons.” In fact, the final effect is akin to a theater piece, only complete as visitors enter and engage with the space. With Pathless Woods , Patterson has done a lot with humble materials, creating a walk to remember. “Mediation is a large part of my life and I wanted Pathless Woods to feel like a meditative experience,” said Patterson. “I believe we can meditate with our eyes closed or widely open — any experience that takes us out of ourselves and our own repetitive thoughts and inner dialogues is for me meditative. I wanted to overload the viewer’s senses in a beautiful way to take them on a journey.” There is a very strong sense of walking through a forest, which makes the piece quite successful, when you consider its constituent parts — ribbon, light, and sound — have very little to do with an actual forest. While every artist, to some degree, is trying to leverage their singular perception to create an accessible experience, it would be difficult to remain unmoved while surrounded by the forest that grew from the seeds of Patterson’s synesthetic gifts.

      "{'title': 'The People in the Paintings', 'unique_id': 134682, 'para': 'The Michael Rosenfeld Gallery’s mission is partly to highlight the achievements of artists who have been historically marginalized in the mainstream art world on the basis of race or gender. Benny Andrews, Alice Neel and Bob Thompson , the gallery’s current exhibition, carries out the institution’s objective with quiet diligence. Most of the paintings on view were completed in the latter part of the twentieth century. What the artists in this show have in common is a commitment to paint the people in their lives. To look at these faces and the bodies on view is to see men and women who “lead lives of quiet desperation,” toiling on the moldy rim of society. The most engaging work balances realist representation and expressionism. I commend the gallery’s thoughtful installation. They do not isolate the individual artists to separate wall space or rooms, but hang their work side by side, in shared space. The decision to pair the artists’ works allows for thoughtful comparison and reflection. Though the installation is dynamic, I really tuned into each artists depiction of people. In Alice Neel’s “Rachel Zurer” (1961—62), the subject sits upright in a comfy old chair. She wears a modest, patterned housedress, which reveals a pair of soft, buttery arms. Her languid pose brings to mind conversation between intimates more than a formal sitting between artist and model. A small crinkle in her lips suggests the beginnings of a smile. The background, painted in animated strokes, operates as a goopy blue halo around the sitter’s head. Unlike the straightforward depiction of face, the background relies less on clear-cut depiction, and more on feeling or expression. The colors appear unnatural and not tied to direct observation. The deliberate tension between pictorial realism and expressionism keeps the viewer off-balance, uneasy. I like this Rachel. I feel as if I know this person. I want to poke her jangly turkey neck. A solitary woman trudges down a stark country path in Benny Andrews’s painting “Down the Road” (1971). Her only companion is a long, black shadow. The image is as rough as the subject’s burlap dress, which conceals large pendulous breasts. Just over her shoulder, a patchwork of wooden shacks and utility poles recede in the distance, wilting under hot daylight. What makes this painting distinctive is the woman’s nose, which juts out from the canvas like a fetid, cantankerous growth. The effect is startling. Andrews developed a rough collage technique, which married rugged scraps of cloth and paint to canvas. Bob Thompson does not depict himself painting in “Self Portrait in the Studio” (1960), but sitting in a threadbare chair in a small gray room. He is shirtless, and his eyes are closed. (Is he sleeping, listening to music, or on the nod?) In the background, just behind him, rests a set of drums, a stack of large, abstract paintings and radio. The studio as man-cave or hideout. It’s resident artist, a slumbering giant. I feel as though I know Bob and the other bug-eyed people, with their tobacco-stained teeth, who are covered in sweat and grime. As I look at these subjects on view, I consider my own body and its steady decline. The creaky limbs, the patches of dry skin in odd places, the unfortunate hair sprouts. Andrews, Neel and Thompson paint the way I feel: broken-down, pieced together and slightly unhinged. It’s humanity as grotesque smorgasbord — eczema, rosacea, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, flat feet and bad teeth. I love the way they use paint. It is applied to the canvas like a kid smearing a slab of butter on toast. The appearance is as unsophisticated as the imagery is stark and uncompromising. The people we see are not easy on the eyes. An existential dread looms like thunder storms in summer.

The network was started by three of the most powerful women in show business, Marcy Carsey, the television producer; Geraldine Laybourne, the television executive credited with making the children's network Nickelodeon a success; and Oprah Winfrey, the television talk-show host. Despite having such a powerful founding troika, the network struggled a bit in its first year with programming and distribution to homes that have cable. Notably absent from the fray was Ms. Winfrey, who was busy starting her own very successful magazine, O: The Oprah Magazine, around the same time. Aside from starring in 12 episodes of an Oxygen show that was a sort of primer on the Internet -- called ''Oprah Goes Online'' -- Ms. Winfrey was not much of a physical presence. So it was not without quite a bit of joy that the executives at Oxygen announced yesterday that Ms. Winfrey would produce a new program. In the untitled series Ms. Winfrey will tell the stories of ''real life heroes'' who have done -- or do -- extraordinary things for others. Ms. Winfrey will narrate segments about her subjects and interview them. Executives said it would make its debut this summer. The network also announced that Ms. Winfrey's Harpo Entertainment would produce two original movies for the network. This is the sort of role that Ms. Laybourne and Ms. Carsey said they had always envisioned for Ms. Winfrey when they recruited her for the venture because she tends to draw so many women to whatever she produces. The executives' hope is, clearly, that when fans learn that Ms. Winfrey will be on the show , they will call their cable companies to demand Oxygen, and the cable companies that do not carry it will feel pressured to get it. ''I think it will be something that people will take notice of,'' Ms. Laybourne said. ''And we'll certainly do our part to make sure they do.''

      "{'title': 'Visionary Offered Surprises Till the End (Published 2011)', 'unique_id': 73546, 'para': 'In its final week of repertory in America, the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, dancing six works in three programs at the Brooklyn Academy of Music from Wednesday to Saturday, kept hitting high after high. The highs kept extending our sense both of these dancers, an exceptionally attractive, diverse and skilled group, and of Cunningham himself. On Friday and Saturday the triple bill included “Pond Way” (1998), “RainForest” (1968) and “Split Sides” (2003). At each performance, toward the end of “Split Sides,” gasps attended an extraordinary solo danced by Silas Riener. As this marvel of both tautness and pliancy moved from position to position, often while changing balance on one leg, he must have done 15 successive acts that were physically astonishing and 50 that went beyond any choreographic precedent. Much of “ Split Sides ” is about maintaining equilibrium while the body is tilting one way or another: this solo takes that challenge to new virtuoso extremes, phenomenal in terms of sheer gymnastics as well as rhythm, shape and linear complexity. It was created for another remarkable dancer, Jonah Bokaer, who danced it many times, superbly. But Cunningham, less than two years before he died, reworked it for Mr. Riener. This far-more-breathtaking version shows Mr. Riener to be one of the superlative performers of our day. It also demonstrates how exploratory Cunningham’s mind still was at the end of his life. With one leg angled to the left side, just how far can you tip and twist your torso over to the right? Keeping one leg stretched straight in front of you, just how deep can you bend your supporting leg? Mr. Riener’s amazing answers to those two questions are the two peak moments of this solo, but there are many other passages that I would hate to forget. Now he maintains five different fragmented lines throughout parts of his body, then with a change of emphasis resolves them into a single satisfying shape. Now he holds a frozen sculptural position from chest down while bringing a hand down over his face as if wrapping a parcel. At another point he shakes his head rapidly while descending slowly; elsewhere he brings his pelvis powerfully into play; later he folds right over on one leg so that his torso, other leg and arms are all like a tight ball as he perches there. It’s as if he’s ticking off a list of unimaginable feats one after another — but in fact his rhythm, with phrasing far more subtle than mere clock timing, is more astonishing than his balance. A very few of his inflections are briefly psychological, as if we’re watching flickers of a brainstorm; a few are also animalistic, as if we’re watching him in a cage at the zoo; but mainly he’s a miracle of calm control and supple audacity. “Split Sides” is a work famous for its use of chance in determining the order of the two musical scores, the two halves of choreography, the two sets of costumes, the two décors and two lighting schemes at a particular performance. Will the Radiohead music play first or the Sigur Ros? Will the half of the dance with Mr. Riener’s solo occur in black-and-white costumes or colored? Apart from this fun, the choreography contains other strokes of wit (notably in a trio for Jennifer Goggans, Brandon Collwes and John Hinrichs) and a recurrent sense of game playing. The main subject of the choreography seems to be multi-directionality in space. And it makes time for stillness. Sometimes a tiny detail becomes luminous. At the start of a quintet with four women Rashaun Mitchell stands still at the back of the stage, facing the audience, his legs apart and arms outstretched low to either side. Once you realize that one of his palms is facing up, the other down, it becomes compelling. Not all of “Split Sides” is top-drawer Cunningham, but it’s exciting: watching, we might be in outer space. One of the central ambiguities of Cunningham dance theater is the degree to which the dance is simply about itself (this dancer moving through this position in this phrasing) versus the extent to which the dance is an image of life outside the theater. In interviews Cunningham liked to emphasize pure movement. The titles of “Pond Way” and “RainForest,” however, are clear indications that he could focus on other imagery. His long-term dance partner Carolyn Brown once wrote, “Psychology doesn’t interest him; zoology and anthropology do.” She may have been referring to “RainForest,” which was indirectly prompted (so Cunningham disclosed after the premiere) by reading the anthropologist Colin Turnbull’s field study of life among the African pygmies, “The Forest People.” But is “RainForest,” which begins with dancers holding their hands like paws, anthropology or zoology? Surely, it’s both (one of its themes is mating), yet neither genre can explain all its images, as when one woman (Krista Nelson) slowly rolls like a log in front of two men. Its third man (Mr. Riener on Friday, Dylan Crossman on Saturday) tilts from one side to the other and back (like a windshield wiper) and, on one leg, folds and unfolds between concave and convex shapes. In the leading role Mr. Mitchell on Friday was the more brooding, Daniel Madoff on Saturday the more electrically intense. In the closing solo Mr. Madoff forcefully irradiated a mass of conflicting movement information, bringing the work to an astounding climax; he was supercharged with self-discovery. For many people “RainForest,” with its famous forest of Andy Warhol helium-filled silver pillows and suggestions of birds and animal sounds in David Tudor’s score, has long been one of the all-time highlights of Cunningham dance theater. I love “Pond Way” even more. Here it seems as though nothing happens but — implicitly — water lilies slowly open and sway, insects skim the surface, ducks upend on water and herons fly or remain stationary. Or, seen objectively, it abounds in characterized stillness and adagio, punctuated but never disturbed by patches of speed. Suzanne Gallo’s beautifully flowing white costumes were her response to Cunningham’s single directive: “Think misty.” Brian Eno’s quiet score, “New Ikebukuro,” is Aeolian: soft chimes and gentle throbs. The idyllic absorption in the processes of nature itself, here all serene, is a Cunningham specialty. It extends our notion of drama simply because there is no conflict or significant tension. “Pond Way” is certainly an expression of Cunningham’s interest in Zen Buddhism, and it is also the closest he ever came to depicting aspects of Thoreau (the “Ponds” chapter of “Walden”). But when I first fell in love with any of Cunningham’s nature studies, over 30 years ago, I had never heard of Zen or Thoreau. Because I grew up in the countryside myself, and because watching birds on the water was part of my childhood education, it brings me back to my beginnings. It finds theater in peacefulness, activity within calm. Because choreography is a focused expression of human energy, the greatest dance theater operates upon us as (among other things) philosophy. Cunningham extended dance, radically; he also extended our minds. A Cunningham season could be fun, drama, challenge, poetry and therapy. For many of us there was no greater adventure.

In ''Eyes Wide Shut,'' the Tom Cruise character takes a taxi to a mansion on Long Island where some mysterious business transpires. Kubrick's cross-cutting from Tom Cruise's point of view in the cab makes it quite clear that his protagonist is taking the exact same route over a bridge from Manhattan to Long Island and as he nears his destination we see a parkway sign overhead that indicates he is on the way to ''Glen Cove.'' The angle and the directional semiotics of the scene are exactly the same, down to the ''Glen Cove'' sign and the pace with which it is cut, as in the parallel scene in ''North by Northwest.''

      "{'title': 'From Michelangelo to Marden, Seven Fierce Fistfights from Art History', 'unique_id': 144284, 'para': 'WASHINGTON, DC — In her ongoing series Le “NEW” Monocle , artist Shana Lutker takes a few famous fistfights instigated by Surrealists in Paris in the 1920s and, after many hours of research, creates stage sets and performances based on their circumstances and philosophical undertones. The completed project will have eight chapters; so far Lutker has finished three, which are currently on view at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden . The first depicts a fight that broke out during Tristan Tzara’s final Dada event in 1923, when André Breton attacked Pierre de Massot with a cane for insulting Picasso, who was also in attendance. The second was inspired by a riot at the 1926 premiere of the Ballets Russes production of Romeo and Julieta , which Breton thought was too commercialized. The third is based on a brawl started by Philippe Soupault and Robert Desnos when they interrupted a 1925 lecture on literature and the “average Frenchman,” taking offense to the term. The combination of big egos, competition, and masculine pride, peppered with large quantities of alcohol, creates an inherent theatricality in the brawls, as rendered by Lutker, that is both fascinating and hilarious. Of course, Surrealists weren’t the only artists prone to fisticuffs. When we think of creative people getting into fights, writers usually are the first that come to mind — Ernest Hemingway , Norman Mailer, Jack London, etc. Even Lutker’s project features far more writers than artists getting into scuffles. Although visual artists may not be as notorious for starting fights, they’ve had their fair share. While Lutker continues to research Surrealist tiffs, art history is full of non-Surrealist punch-ups that would make potent fodder for future installations. We’ve compiled brief synopses of a few of our favorites. Florence, circa 1490: Pietro Torrigiano vs. Michelangelo As a teenager, Torrigiano was the most talented young sculptor working for Lorenzo de Medici. Then Michelangelo, who was three years younger, came along and blew up Torrigiano’s spotlight. One day, while Michelangelo was busy sketching, Torrigiano took his revenge, punching the younger artist hard and breaking his nose. Fearing the wrath of de Medici, Torrigiano fled Florence and ended up in England, working for Henry VIII. Winner: Draw. Torrigiano technically won the fight, but he had to leave Florence at the height of the Renaissance because of it. Michelangelo, on the other hand, had a broken nose his whole life, but it didn’t seem to have an adverse effect on his work. For the full story, see George Bull’s Michelangelo: A Biography . Rome, 1606: Caravaggio vs. The Pimp It’s been well documented that the hot-blooded Caravaggio got into a lot of fights, and even killed a young man named Ranuccio Tomassoni. What remain unclear are the circumstances that led to the brawl. The most popular theory is that the two got into a fight over bets on a tennis match. Other theories include a duel over Tomassoni’s wife and/or a prostitute working for him, and that Caravaggio may have tried to castrate Tomassoni. Winner: Caravaggio, although his brutish lifestyle eventually caught up with him, when he was killed by a revenge-seeker at the age of 38. Read more about the murderous Caravaggio here . London, 1890: James McNeill Whistler vs. The Confused Editor Whistler was a proud peacock, often butting heads with anyone who criticized him or his work — he even sued critic John Ruskin for libel. The September 7, 1890, issue of the San Francisco Call describes a “most disgraceful and exciting fist fight” between Whistler and August Moore, editor of The Hawk . Whistler “carried a blackthorn stick, and when he caught sight of Moore he raised the heavy stick and rushed at the editor, whose hat was smashed with the first blow he received.” A brawl ensued that included the manager of the theater where the attack took place and a few of Whistler’s friends. Moore landed at least one punch, when “he struck Whistler one blow between the eyes, straight from the shoulder, which felled the artist to the floor.” The article ends with: “Moore is at a loss to account for Whistler’s conduct, since the Hawk had not published anything about him for several weeks.” Winner: Whistler. Even after the artist was kicked out of the theater, the manager continued beating up the flabbergasted Moore. No one likes a critic. Read the full San Francisco Call article here . Petrograd, 1915: Kazimir Malevich vs. Vladimir Tatlin The Futurists (both in Italy and Russia) had a tendency to come to blows over differing opinions on art and aesthetics. In the lead-up to the Russian Revolution, Malevich and Tatlin found themselves on opposite sides. While Malevich favored creativity and the philosophical, Tatlin preached order and realism. The artists’ competing ideals came to a head at the Last Futurist Exhibition of Paintings 0.10 , where they got into a fistfight, supposedly delaying the opening. Winner: Tatlin, if only retroactively. In the immediate aftermath of the revolution, the USSR praised his Constructivist ideas and banned the abstraction that Malevich held so dear. For details on the brawl and everything that led up to it, see Will Gompertz’s What Are You Looking At? The Surprising, Shocking, and Sometimes Strange Story of 150 Years of Modern Art . Paris, 1937: Battle of Picasso’s Mistresses Marie-Thérèse Walter had been Picasso’s mistress and model for about 10 years (and had just given birth to his daughter) when a photographer named Dora Maar came along, threatening to replace her. When the two women told Picasso to choose between them, the artist is famously quoted as having recalled, “I was satisfied with things as they were. I told them they’d have to fight it out themselves. So they began to wrestle. It’s one of my choicest memories.” Meanwhile, Picasso calmly returned to painting “Guernica.” Winner: Picasso. Technically, Maar won this one, but she was replaced several years later by a new muse, lover, and model, Françoise Gilot. So, Picasso wins. Picasso always wins. Read more on Picasso’s love life here . New York, 1961: Willem de Kooning vs. Clement Greenberg Proud of their rugged masculinity, the Abstract Expressionists couldn’t resist a good brawl, often fighting each other at Cedar Tavern and Dillon’s, their favorite hangouts. In the fall of 1961, during a lecture on Abstract Expressionism at the Guggenheim, critic Clement Greenberg (a champion of Jackson Pollock, de Kooning’s rival) commented that de Kooning’s art had been better before 1950. A couple of months later, the two ran into each other at Dillon’s, where a confrontation led to de Kooning allegedly punching Greenberg in the face. (Greenberg, of course, tells a different story.) Winner: de Kooning, who was never worried about any trouble he may have caused with his incessant brawling. (Earlier in 1961, reporting on the fallout from a different fight, the New York Times ran an article with the headline, “DeKooning [sic], Sued in Bar Fight, Is Too Busy Painting to Appear.”) For more about de Kooning and his fistfights, see Annalyn Swan and Mark Stevens’  de Kooning: An American Master . New York, circa 1980: Julian Schnabel vs. Brice Marden New York-based artists in the 1980s continued the Abstract Expressionists’ traditions of heavy drinking and bar fights. In Schnabel’s 1987 autobiography, he recounts that he once got into a scuffle with Marden when, seeking to put the presumptuous younger artist back in his place, Marden called him a “student.” Winner: Both, together with the inflated art market. Schnabel and Marden are two of the world’s richest living artists. For more on Julian Schnabel, see his autobiography, CVJ: Nicknames of Maitre D’s and Other Excerpts from Life .

      "{'title': 'Marfa to Vegas: The Good, Bad and Ugly', 'unique_id': 142047, 'para': 'The Good Marfa, Texas is the uberchic rural town that the art world loves to visit when venturing out of the urban jungle. Sprinkled amongst its boutique shops and quaint restaurants are some of America’s, and arguably the world’s, most impressive art destinations. Donald Judd’s not-so-little cement block outdoor and indoor installation was the driving force behind the Chinati Foundation’s support and exhibition of major public art projects and it artist-in-residence program. The interplay between Judd’s installations — shape line and volume — is mesmerizing and much like their Minimalist aesthetic, an in-person confrontation with his work defies description. It seems incongruous to have such a monumental artwork happen in such a out of the way place — and this is what put Marfa on the map so to speak. As a result, like-minded projects such as Elmgreen and Dragset’s “Prada Marfa” (2005) isolated on the side of the road some 37 miles outside of town has become another art visitor landmark. The 2005 Fall/Winter collection featured inside the shop still appears sexy and fresh despite the billows of dust that get thrown up at the shop with every passing truck. The Bad The El Paso Museum of Art is a mix of classical, modern and contemporary art. This year the museum boasts an exhibition Magnificent Mexico: 20 th Century Modern Masterworks . This exhibition, which is comprised of three separate exhibitions dealing with painting, drawing and Diego Rivera’s relationship to Cubism, originated at two different museums in Mexico City — and have been awkwardly brought together in El Paso under a new umbrella title. Although the exhibition features highlights of works by heavy hitters such as David Sequiros , Jose Clemente Orozco and a masterful and gorgeously dark painting by Alberto Gironella , the exhibition is sadly and badly installed, the accompanying wall texts semi-coherent and although a significant cross-section of artists are represented many of the examples of work are far from the claimed “masterworks.” Fifty-one artists and 91 artwork may be a notable statistic but it does not an impressive exhibition make. More Good A redeeming factor of the museum experience however is an exhibition in the museum lobby by Mexican-born El Paso-based contemporary artist Margarita Cabrera (the museum will be rotating her work in the lobby over the next year). It’s playful and cool, and her fabric and clay recreations of everyday and household objects smack of skillful craftsmanship and graceful innuendo. The objects she depicts are made by foreigners for US consumers. Expanding on this theme of labor the exhibition depicts a life-size tractor as a reference to the working agricultural community. The Ugly Last stop Las Vegas, which is not exactly a contemporary art hub. However there is something to be said for immense production capabilities of the city’s famous strip — and the mind boggles at what could be done if this kind of infrastructure could be placed in the hands of a artists like Matthew Barney , Jeppe Hein , Olafur Eliasson or Lang and Baumann (L/B). Unfortunately the furthest the Las Vegas strip stretched to embrace contemporary art is to showcase an installation by an artist who is second on the list of artists I love to hate (closely behind Romero Britto who tops my list). Runner up Dale Chihuly’s large garish blown glass overhang graces the center ceiling of the monumental entrance-way of the Bellagio hotel — one of the more upscale and “tastefully” designed Las Vegas destinations. Its not that I don’t have undying respect for Chihuly’s immense skill at glass blowing or the fascinating possibilities of the medium of glass, however the work is inescapably decorative, aesthetically over-the-top … and not in an ironic way, which would make it quite cool. Without a sense of humor to embrace the “culture kitsch” that oozes out of every pore of Las Vegas, Chihuly’s off-pastel shades and inability to diversify his floral products means his “serious” installations just misses the mark. It’s like hanging Swarovski crystal decorations on a plastic Christmas tree and pretending it’s a luscious fur, and the result is that Chihuly’s Sistine ceiling looks like a mangled cluster of sickly foliage. Donald Judd’s installation at the Cinnati Foundation and Elmgreen and Dragset’s “Prada Marfa” (2005) are permanently on view in and around Marfa, Texas.

      "{'title': 'Samplings of Piano Princes; a Queenly Opera (Published 2006)', 'unique_id': 69315, 'para': 'AN album of encore pieces has long been such a tired concept for a classical recording that most artists would not think to try it. So give the pianist Leif Ove Andsnes enormous credit for having come up with a truly fresh and exquisitely played album of short works for his latest EMI recording. From the first item, an étude from a collection of 13 piano pieces by Sibelius, this program is filled with surprises. Who knew that this brooding Finnish symphonist had written études, especially a bouncy piece like this? Yet the music is tinged with minor-mode wistfulness, which Mr. Andsnes conveys in a fleet and nimble performance. On the next track he offers two impromptus by Scriabin that again confound expectations. These are lilting Chopinesque works, played with lyricism and impetuosity. Mr. Andsnes also pays homage to the declining art of the piano transcription. He includes Busoni’s transcription of a somber Bach chorale prelude; Walter Gieseking’s delicately textured transcription of an early song by Richard Strauss, “Ständchen”; Liszt’s tasteful transcription of a little song by Chopin; and Mr. Andsnes’s own transcription of a soulful work for violin and piano by his Norwegian countryman Johan Halvorsen. He offers chestnuts too, including Liszt’s “Liebestraum” No. 3 and even Debussy’s “Clair de Lune,” played so lovingly that they sound rediscovered. Still, many of the selections (22 in all) will be unfamiliar discoveries for most listeners: an Albéniz tango, a tumultuous concert étude by Smetana, a pulsating toccata by George Antheil; delightful pieces by Ibert, Cyril Scott and Federico Mompou, the 20th-century Spanish composer whose bittersweet, Impressionistic pieces Mr. Andsnes has championed. “Mr. Nobody” is credited with the jazzy arrangement of a wistful chanson by Charles Trenet. Who is he? Mr. Andsnes is protecting his source. ANTHONY TOMMASINI MUSIC makes aristocrats of its talented practitioners. Paul Hindemith, on the other hand, worked very hard at democracy. In his lifetime — he died in 1963 — he was quietly everywhere, quietly doing everything. We notice him less these days. Maybe he had too much good sense for his own good. The piano pieces of “Ludus Tonalis” remind us of Hindemith’s great range. (He played virtually every instrument and composed nothing he could not manage himself.) They also remind us of his deep curiosity about how music is constructed and his zeal, through books of instruction and compositions of limited difficulty, to bring players with all levels of musical skill closer to the art. His little manual on ear-training is still the best of its kind that I know. The Latin title implies game playing, and here Hindemith is both scholar and wit in series of fugues that perform all the theoretical acrobatics of music; themes are turned backward and upside down, and held up to mirrors. There are palindromes to boot. Before each fugue is an “interludium” after the manner of Bach — some busy, others gently rhapsodic. Every piece is loosely governed by traditional tonality, but each sounds tonal in its own way. Rarely has music that bristles with so much learning been dispensed with such appealing modesty. Hindemith, a German, sat out World War II at Yale, which is where he wrote “Ludus Tonalis.” Also on this CD is his Suite “1922” from 20 years earlier, which he later disavowed. It is a more public piece: sometimes mock-heroic, often bitonal and in general intent on offending conservative sensibilities. Its five movements show a fascination with, among other American phenomena, the shimmy and ragtime. Boris Berezovsky’s excellent playing does a service to Hindemith and to music. BERNARD HOLLAND THERE are two approaches to filming opera: You can document a staged production or try to create a film that is viable in its own right. In reimagining her successful Opera North production of Britten’s “Gloriana” for television, the director Phyllida Lloyd did both. The film captures the essentials of the production but also deals head-on with the artifice of opera. Rather than presenting the singers as naturalistic characters, it shows them backstage, donning their costumes and bantering with each other before assuming their parts. This approach is particularly effective in “Gloriana,” which is all about appearances and the roles people play, notably the tension between Elizabeth I’s roles as queen and as woman. Ms. Lloyd extends the concept by underlining the trappings of the royal court. For her first entrance the queen is borne on stage in all her finery, looking like one of those statues carried by the faithful at Italian church holidays. “Gloriana,” one of Britten’s grandest operas, was not well received at its 1953 premiere. The portrait of a willful, erratic monarch was not ideal for the coronation of the second Queen Elizabeth. Another reason for its limited success may be its uncompromising portrait of an aging woman, something contemporary culture has yet to get comfortable with. Josephine Barstow exposes herself bravely, willing to look like hell in an impressive performance marred only by vocal stridency. The tenor Tom Randle is terrific as the hot-blooded, reckless Earl of Essex. The opera was filmed to a tape of Paul Daniel ably conducting the English Northern Philharmonia. This procedure proves less distracting than the cuts: charged with making a 100-minute film, Ms. Lloyd had to sacrifice several scenes. The trade-off is a film that works on its own terms and makes a good case for a prickly, wonderful and unjustly neglected opera.

      "{'title': 'A Niche of Stylish Power (Published 2011)', 'unique_id': 76796, 'para': 'LONDON — Design has always been a man’s world, at least it was until very recently. Just look in design history books. You’ll see lots and lots of men, starting with the first industrial designers, mostly eminent artists, like Charles Le Brun, who designed tapestries for Gobelins in 17th-century France, and George Stubbs, whose ceramics were manufactured by Wedgwood in 18th-century England. Wedgwood’s founder, the redoutable Josiah Wedgwood, took the unusual step of commissioning some designs from women in the 1780s. All of his female designers were fashionable aristocrats, and their networks of high society friends may have appealed to him at least as much as their artistic abilities. But one of those women was talented enough for her designs to sell so well that they were widely copied by Wedgwood’s competitors — Elizabeth Templetown. I should point out right now that Templetown’s subjects weren’t the stuff of feminist fantasy. The names say it all: “Domestic Employment,” “Maternal Affection” and “Family School.” Wedgwood wanted her work to appeal to the female market, and she obliged by creating tender scenes of women engaged in domestic tasks or loving mothers embracing their children to decorate ceramic objects like teapots, vases and buckles. But she executed her designs so successfully that Templetown set an impressive precedent as one of the very first women designers. “She just did a handful of designs for Wedgwood, but they clearly hit a nerve in the market,” said Hilary Young, a senior curator of ceramics and glass at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London. “Templetown’s designs were very sentimental, not particularly to my taste, but they do stand up well as good pieces of their kind. She was clearly a very competent designer.” Templetown was born Elizabeth Boughton in 1747, the eldest of the four children of Shuckburgh Boughton, the younger son of a baronet, and Mary Greville, daughter of a lord and granddaughter of a duke. Privileged though her upbringing was, Templetown’s parents were considerably less wealthy and powerful than many of their relatives, who had inherited great estates and imposing titles. In 1769, she made a respectable, though not spectacular, marriage to Clotworthy Upton, who came from a military and political family. Like his wife, Upton was able and ambitious. He secured a senior post in the royal household and in 1776 was given the title Baron Templetown, making Mrs. Upton the first Lady Templetown. By then they had two sons, Fulke and John, and a baby daughter, Elizabeth. The couple were sought-after in London society, where Templetown was renowned for her flair as an amateur artist. In 1783, they commissioned the neoclassical architect Robert Adam to remodel their country home, a 16th-century castle in Northern Ireland that an enterprising Upton had purchased early in the 17th century and renamed Castle Upton. Just as “artistic” late-18th-century society ladies like Templetown followed the work of fashionable architects, like Adam, they were also fascinated by the Industrial Revolution. Decades later, the English upper classes would view industrialization with disdain, but in the late 1700s it was still in its infancy and the most progressive factories were regarded as thrillingly dynamic. The most dynamic industrialist of all was Wedgwood. Having learned his trade as an apprentice potter, he opened his own pottery in his native Staffordshire in 1758. Fascinated by science, he constantly developed new materials and techniques. He combined an entrepreneurial flair for marketing with the strategic vision to make bold investments — in canals, for instance, to transport his fragile wares. Wedgwood also had a keen interest in art. He encouraged gifted artists, such as Stubbs, John Flaxman and Joseph Wright, to design for the company and undertook ambitious projects. Among them was the Green Frog Service, commissioned in 1773 by Catherine the Great, empress of Russia. It consisted of 952 pieces, each of which depicted a frog and a scene from British life. Wedgwood dispatched artists all over the country to sketch and paint forests, rivers and castles, and also ironworks and canals. One artist set off with a newfangled camera obscura. Unsurprisingly, Templetown and her friends were dazzled by Wedgwood’s achievements. Decorating plain Wedgwood porcelain became a stylish feminine accomplishment akin to singing and needlework. In her book on Wedgwood and his circle, “The Lunar Men,” Jenny Uglow suggests that some socialites, possibly including Templetown, approached him to ask if their designs could be manufactured in his factories. Whoever approached whom, Templetown’s first designs for Wedgwood proved so popular that in 1783 he wrote a (rather gushing) letter praising her “charming” work, and “expressing a wish to be indulged” with more of her designs. Templetown’s role as a designer consisted of drawing her touching scenes in pencil or cutting them out of India paper. Those images were then faithfully replicated in fine white stoneware by William Hackwood, Wedgwood’s most skillful modeler, and the results used to embellish ceramic objects. Often her subjects were inspired by classical mythology, though she also drew on 18th-century writers like Goethe and Laurence Sterne. Many of Templetown’s pieces now belong to museum collections and her most successful designs remained in production until recently. Her husband died in 1785, leaving her a widow with three children in her late 30s. A portrait, painted five years later by John Downman, depicts her as a strikingly attractive woman, fashionably dressed and coiffed, not a conventional beauty, but spirited and determined. She never remarried and she spent much of her later life in Italy. Templetown died in 1823, after seeing her son John being given the grand title of Viscount Templetown and her daughter Elizabeth make a dazzling marriage to the Marquess of Bristol. Other socialites designed for Wedgwood, including Diana Beauclerk, daughter of the Duke of Marlborough, and Emma Crewe, whose wealthy mother was one of the company’s best customers.

His death was announced by his wife, Prudence Fairweather. Chamberlain was eighty-four years old. “Chamberlain devoted his life to challenging traditional notions of sculpture and to eroding the boundaries between sculpture and painting,” writes Kennedy. “He was among a wave of late-modernist sculptors who put color on an almost equal footing with form.” Of his attraction to mangled automobiles and scrap yard material, Chamberlain once said, “I saw all this material just lying around against buildings, and it was in color, so I felt I was ahead on two counts . . . I think of my art materials not as junk but as garbage. Manure, actually; it goes from being the waste material of one being to the life-source of another.” The artist, who was born in Indiana and raised by his grandmother in Chicago, joined the Navy in 1943 and served in the Pacific and Mediterranean. After returning, he worked as a hairdresser and makeup artist while trying to teach himself how to draw. He later enrolled in the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and then, in 1956, entered Black Mountain College in North Carolina. Kennedy notes that some of his early influences included a selection of painters, poets, and sculptors he met at Cedar Tavern in Greenwich Village, especially Franz Kline and Willem de Kooning: “Kline gave me the structure, de Kooning gave me the color,” the artist once said. Chamberlain represented the United States at the Venice Biennale in 1967 and in 1970 received his first retrospective, held at the Solomon R. Guggenheim museum. His work is included in dozens of museum collections, including the Guggenheim, the Museum of Modern Art, and Dia Beacon. In 2011, one of his older pieces sold at auction for $4.7 million, a record for his work. Of Chamberlain’s practice, Peter Schjeldahl wrote in 1969 that, “As with a sunset or a snowstorm, you don’t know whether there’s an operating intelligence behind it all or not, so you learn to accept the manifestations for themselves. The mangle is the message.” Chamberlain, who derided those who tried to intellectualize his work, put it more plainly: “Everyone always wanted to know what it meant, you know: ‘What does it mean, jellybean?’ Even if I knew, I could only know what I thought it meant . . . If I feel so glad that a sculpture is here, and I don’t care who did it, then I figure it’s a good piece.”', 'author': None, 'url': ['https://www.artforum.com/news/john-chamberlain-1927-2011-29897'], 'tags': None, 'captions': None, 'pubtime': datetime.datetime(2011, 12, 22, 0, 0), 'source': 'Artforum'}\n",

The forty-one-foot bronze, aluminum, and stainless steel work\\x97depicting a hand holding eleven tulips and conceived as a memorial sculpture to honor the victims of the 2015 Charlie Hebdo and Bataclan theater attacks in Paris\\x97has sparked debate since it was proposed in June 2016 due to its design, cost, and location.

French and American donors, including Kenneth C. Griffin, Weber Investments, Bloomberg, Leonard A. Lauder, and Moët Hennesy - Louis Vuitton, funded the project. Koons said in an interview last week that he contributed $1 million to cushion escalating costs following delays. Koons and the city of Paris have signed an agreement to funnel 80 percent of revenues and royalties from the work to associations for the victims’ families and 20 percent to the city for the piece’s maintenance. “The sculpture was created as a symbol of remembrance, optimism, and healing,” Koons said at the ceremony.', 'author': None, 'url': ['https://www.artforum.com/news/controversial-jeff-koons-tulip-sculpture-inaugurated-in-paris-80961'], 'tags': None, 'captions': ['', 'Rendering of Jeff Koons’s', 'Bouquet of Tulips.', ''], 'pubtime': datetime.datetime(2019, 10, 4, 0, 0), 'source': 'Artforum'}\n",

He presents a number of accessorized pedestals ranging from slickly finished, deliberately skewed bases to found supports—including a mover’s dolly—topped with clumsily streamlined organic-shaped, carcasslike forms. Made of wood frames and found objects surrounded by foam and padding products and tightly wrapped with packing tape of every color, the figures spill their material guts through tears in their skins. Morrison also moves from organic to geometric with a tower pieced together from Styrofoam scraps, slathered in red and pink paint and held erect by an obvious armature—a nice riff on minimalism, finish fetish, and phallic architecture. But the real standout is a stack of flat, complex geometric forms made of brightly painted Styrofoam. The shapes are oddly familiar, and it doesn’t take long to figure out that they’ve been lifted from the outlines of graffiti tags. This is solid young work—cosmopolitan and street-smart, all grit, all refinement, sad and celebratory, trashy, and formally sophisticated. — Christopher Miles', 'author': 'Christopher Miles', 'url': ['https://www.artforum.com/picks/joel-morrison-1111'], 'tags': None, 'captions': ['Untitled,', '2001.'], 'pubtime': datetime.datetime(2001, 5, 26, 0, 0), 'source': 'Artforum'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Inside Prince’s Paisley Park Archives: 7,000 Artifacts Cataloged, Many More to Go (Published 2017)', 'unique_id': 91628, 'para': 'Last August, when Angie Marchese became director of archives at Paisley Park, the rock star Prince’s studio and residence, one of the first things she did was to get rid of all the candles. Festooning nearly every room of the compound, they came in all sizes, shapes, colors and scents (including a few of Prince’s own aromatic blends). “We replaced all the real candles with artificial candles,” Ms. Marchese said in an interview this week in an anteroom at the compound, as her team prepared for a series of events marking the one-year anniversary of Prince’s death on Friday . (Her crew cataloged and archived the originals.) “We still wanted the essence of the candles, and how they made the rooms feel, without the fire hazard,” she explained. “Prince can burn Paisley Park down, but I can’t.” Ms. Marchese and her team — the same group that oversees Elvis Presley’s Memphis mansion-turned-tourist-stop Graceland — have been tasked with maintaining the grounds of Paisley Park, which Prince built in this remote suburb of Minneapolis in 1987. Once a commercial recording studio, with a soundstage also available for hire, Paisley Park became Prince’s residence during his final years, and throughout its history he hosted hundreds of private concerts and dance parties for fans. In October, the complex opened as a museum that showcases instruments, clothes, awards and other ephemera. But, like Prince himself, the process of telling his history was mysterious. How did the team go about discovering, cataloging, selecting and displaying Prince’s life via his massive collection of objects? “The best part about the exhibition at Paisley, like Paisley itself, it’s a living, breathing exhibition,” Ms. Marchese said. The goal of the museum isn’t to tell Prince’s story from birth to death, but to capture what it was about his home base that reflected his creativity and vision. To that end, “It’s constantly being updated,” she said, noting that Prince’s family has been involved from the beginning. “They’re very aware of our process.” So far, Paisley’s archival team has cataloged more than 7,000 items — a number Ms. Marchese considers “less than 5 percent” of the building’s holdings. One key difference between Graceland and Paisley Park, she said, is that where Vernon Presley, Elvis’s Depression-weathered father, kept tight to every receipt, most of the Paisley paper trail has been creative: “We’ve got the sketches for the wardrobe, handwritten notes, lyrics on backs of envelopes or notepads, things like that.” In fact, most of the earliest materials discovered so far are direct remnants of Prince’s private working processes. Ms. Marchese mentioned some 20 spiral-bound notebooks from across his career, including one containing the lyrics of his first album, “For You,” and the famous purple-covered notebook titled “Dreams” — the working title of the 1984 movie “Purple Rain.” “We have on display here his Walkman, with cassette tapes that are dated 1977,” she said. “From what we’re told, he was never far from his Walkman. He was constantly recording himself. He would write lyrics on anything. It’s like he couldn’t turn his brain off. He was constantly just purging all of his creative energy onto paper.” “He had beautiful penmanship,” Ms. Marchese added. “Gorgeous handwriting.” A large portion of the archiving time has been devoted to clothing. An entire garage, with a 20-foot ceiling, was found packed with stage outfits, along with clothes in closets, in wardrobe containers, in boxes and in suitcases. Prince, who died at 57, never stopped dressing the part of pop’s royal peacock. (He didn’t require much fabric; he stood 5-foot-2 and had a 22-and-a-half-inch waist.) One of the items Ms. Marchese displayed at this behind-the-scenes look at the archiving process was a thick sketchbook for Prince’s one-of-a-kind designs, complete with fabric swatches. His seamstresses made the clothes on-site at Paisley Park in a dedicated upstairs room; one, the costume designer Debbie McGuan, who began working for him in the mid-90s, has come on board to help identify outfits. The number of pieces of clothing may be rivaled only by Prince’s formidable collection of shoes. “Every outfit had a matching pair of shoes,” Ms. Marchese said, citing a pair that went with a red-and-black suit Prince wore to his 2004 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, where he paid tribute to George Harrison with a scorching guitar solo on “While My Guitar Gently Weeps,” and the teal shoes he sported at the 2007 Super Bowl halftime show, designed to match an outfit the color of the Miami Dolphins’ uniforms. “Most of them are ankle boots and have three-inch heels on them .” Ms. Marchese described discovering a closet packed with footwear (“You’d think it would have been a coat closet, but we opened it up, and it was full of shoes”), none flats. “Even his flip-flops were wedges,” Ms. Marchese said. “Even his tennis shoes are wedges.” Prince did not rewear his flashy outfits. In fact, he seldom wore the same thing twice. “On the ‘Purple Rain’ tour, we have 35 jackets and 35 pairs of pants,” Ms. Marchese said. “And actually, sometimes, we’d have double the pairs of pants. They’re identical pants, but they’re just doubles.” One thing you won’t find in the archives: leisure wear. “Prince didn’t seem to have any at-home wear,” Ms. Marchese said. “Prince was always Prince.” But the clothing tells a story all the same: “You can also see as he matured, how his style became more elegant and more of a legend look — not necessarily trying to make a dramatic statement. He was already who he was.” Once each piece of clothing — or whatever else — has been photographed, identified and entered into a computer database, with each detail painstakingly recorded, it is wrapped in acid-free tissue and given its own acid-free box. The team is cataloging a selection of Prince’s jewelry, from cuff links to necklaces and rings, much of which is costume jewelry, Ms. Marchese noted. Ear cuffs have been found in jewelry boxes, desk drawers and a closet; there are “boxes and boxes of sunglasses,” most of which weren’t name brand. And her crew also uncovered a sizable collection of makeup: “suitcases of it.” The brand Prince favored was Mac. “There’s a lot of Mac: eyeliner, foundation, cover-up-type stuff,” she said. “He was always ready to be filmed whenever he was out in public.” The process of preserving Prince’s large collection of instruments has involved reaching out to his original guitar techs over the years. Each guitar is cleaned, restrung and, perhaps most surprisingly, played, “because that’s what the instruments were made to do,” Ms. Marchese said. “We went back to the people who knew the guitars, the people who actually worked with him and worked with the guitars.” Indicating a Vox guitar with a psychedelic painting on the front, Ms. Marchese described finding it in a basement room with more than 120 guitars hanging on the walls and in cases. And she said her team discovered something unusual when it was cleaning and preparing the pale blue Fender Stratocaster that Prince played at the Super Bowl: water damage. “It was, like, of course,” she said. “He played it in the middle of a basic hurricane during the Super Bowl.” Prince, it turns out, was a bit of a gear pack rat. Ms. Marchese described, in addition to guitars, drum kits and keyboards, road cases full of stage equipment, lighting trusses. “Pieces like that, you’d think, ‘Why does he still have them?’ That’s a really unique part of the collection,” she said. Though the archivists have no purview over Paisley Park’s “massive audio-video collection,” Ms. Marchese said, there’s more than enough to keep them busy. She even found an old tour bus parked around the building’s side. “It looks like it’s from the early ’90s from the color palette inside,” she said. “We’re nowhere near even started, really.”', 'author': None, 'url': ['https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/arts/music/prince-paisley-park-archives.html'], 'tags': None, 'captions': ['There are over 7,000 objects, 120 guitars, 2,000 pairs shoes and zero pairs of flats.

His best-known work on home turf occurred in 1974 at Claire Copley Gallery, where in one cunning gesture, he simply removed the wall separating the exhibition space from the office. Much of his local renown is based on his long-standing faculty position at CalArts, where he influenced several generations of artists (including Christopher Williams, Stephen Prina, and Edgar Arceneaux, among dozens of note) who endured his infamous tough-love poststudio crit marathons, sometimes lasting eight hours or more. What’s even more surprising is that Asher’s current exhibition at the Santa Monica Museum of Art—a homecoming of sorts—is nothing short of a crowd-pleaser. Undoubtedly, such a phrase would give a serious artist like Asher pause, but the untitled, research-driven intervention, which reconstructs the entire ten-year history of this kunsthalle’s temporary architecture as a palimpsest of (mostly) aluminum stud walls, is a rather dazzling thing to experience and likely to win over an audience unfamiliar with “institutional critique.” After signing a legal waiver, one wanders aimlessly through a labyrinthine construction that varies in visual and spatial density, and the stud walls—occasionally in thickets three or four layers deep—reveal the institution’s (mostly pragmatic) patterns of exhibition and display that level the differences of forty past shows as varied as Thelma Golden’s “Freestyle” (2001), an Ant Farm retrospective (2004), and “Enigma Variations” (2006), which paired Philip Guston and Giorgio de Chirico. Conceptually rigorous, but thankfully open-ended and nonhierarchical, Asher’s exhibition is surely more of a warm embrace of the institution than a critique of it—a sly move for an artist who has modestly disrupted expectations for nearly forty years. — Michael Ned Holte', 'author': 'Michael Ned Holte', 'url': ['https://www.artforum.com/picks/michael-asher-19647'], 'tags': None, 'captions': ['View of “Michael Asher.”'], 'pubtime': datetime.datetime(2008, 3, 10, 0, 0), 'source': 'Artforum'}\n",

But outdoor concerts are also, improbably, wonderful and fun. That’s what has made the New York Philharmonic’s free Concerts in the Parks so popular for 54 years. Of course, it all depends upon the weather. And it was ideal on Wednesday night — balmy, clear and breezy — as more than 50,000 people gathered on the Great Lawn in Central Park to hear Jaap van Zweden, concluding his first season as the Philharmonic’s music director, lead the orchestra in a nicely varied program. The weather was not so pleasant on Monday for another free outdoor concert: the Metropolitan Opera’s Summer Recital Series , the first of six recitals in all five boroughs of New York. After a day of soaking rain, several hundred intrepid opera lovers were not about to let some periodic showers prevent them from hearing three fine singers — the soprano Ying Fang, the tenor Ben Bliss and the baritone Nathan Gunn — perform arias, duets and songs with the pianist Dan Saunders. The inclement weather on Monday actually made the ardent performances of these undeterred singers more special. The evening began with a short medley from Mozart’s “Die Zauberflöte.” The hapless bird catcher Papageno has been a signature role for Mr. Gunn, who gave a hearty account of “Die Vogelfänger bin ich ja.” Then Mr. Bliss brought his honeyed lyric tenor voice to Tamino’s declaration of love, and Mr. Gunn returned to join the radiant-voiced Ms. Fang for a winning account of the duet “Bei Männern,” a beguiling tribute to marital devotion. There was some more Mozart, as well as arias from Tchaikovsky, Puccini and Korngold, and songs from “Carousel” (including Mr. Gunn in a dramatic performance of “Soliloquy”). The sound system of the extensively renovated SummerStage facility allowed the voices to come through without too much amplified boosting. On Wednesday, Mr. van Zweden bounded onstage and began with a lively, trim account of Rossini’s overture to “La Gazza Ladra.” Then Deborah Borda, the Philharmonic’s president, introduced two participants in the orchestra’s Very Young Composers initiative , which gives children, whatever their musical backgrounds, opportunities to work with professionals to turn their ideas into short compositions. Nilomi Weerakkody, 12, narrated her two-minute piece, “Soundscape,” as the orchestra played it. The music unfolds in four layers. As each was added, she described it. The first depicted flowing, distant waters with swirling sounds and flecks of instrumental colors. The next suggested slowly treading footsteps, followed by the twittering, skittish sounds of birds. The last evoked animals in rumbling figures with periodic grunts. Then Mack Scocca-Ho, also 12, spoke about “Ociantrose,” a three-minute piece he named after an imaginary city where order is created by the people and not imposed from above, he said. (The work was introduced earlier this season as part of the orchestra’s Phil the Hall program.) The music is bustling and industrious, with neoclassical episodes that shift into a rich, chorale-like final section. Copland’s feisty “Hoe-Down” from “Rodeo” brought the first half to a close. Then came the program’s main course, Rachmaninoff’s Second Symphony. As in a performance of the piece earlier this season , Mr. van Zweden brought coherence to an hourlong score that can seem long-winded, conveying the music’s Russian Romantic fervor and shifting moods without pushing things to excess.

Earlier this month its archrival Christie’s announced equivalent 2018 sales of $7 billion. Sotheby’s said its 2018 performance had been bolstered by $1 billion in private sales, up 37 percent from the previous year. But profitability was down. The auction house achieved a net income of $108.6 million, or $2.09 per diluted share, compared with $118.8 million, or $2.20 per diluted share, in 2017. Sotheby’s incurred significant losses on some high-value lots guaranteed at auctions, such as a Modigliani nude, which sold below the amount promised to the seller for $157.2 million in May, and a $30 million abstract, “ Pre-War Pageant ,” by the American modernist Marsden Hartley that failed to sell in November. The following month, Adam Chinn, the company’s chief operating officer, stepped down and his role was eliminated. But Sotheby’s said it had achieved notable auction highs for contemporary artists such as Kerry James Marshall and Jenny Saville , and had raised $1 billion in auction sales in Asia, the highest total for the company. The auction house’s investment in new technology had resulted in $72.1 million of online-only sales, four times the total of the previous year. “Over all, you will see a company in great shape for the future,” said Tad Smith , president and chief executive. He added that the “expectation for our company in 2019 is favorable,” but acknowledged that “the range of outcomes has a bit more uncertainty than when we entered 2018,” because of factors like geopolitics.

      "{'title': 'Hunting for the Dawn of Writing, When Prehistory Became History (Published 2010)', 'unique_id': 52345, 'para': 'CHICAGO \\x97 One of the stars of the Oriental Institute’s new show, “Visible Language: Inventions of Writing in the Ancient Middle East and Beyond,” is a clay tablet that dates from around 3200 B.C. On it, written in cuneiform, the script language of ancient Sumer in Mesopotamia, is a list of professions, described in small, repetitive impressed characters that look more like wedge-shape footprints than what we recognize as writing. In fact “it is among the earliest examples of writings that we know of so far,” according to the institute’s director, Gil J. Stein, and it provides insights into the life of one of the world’s oldest cultures. The new exhibition by the institute, part of the University of Chicago, is the first in the United States in 26 years to focus on comparative writing. It relies on advances in archaeologists’ knowledge to shed new light on the invention of scripted language and its subsequent evolution. The show demonstrates that, contrary to the long-held belief that writing spread from east to west, Sumerian cuneiform and its derivatives and Egyptian hieroglyphics evolved separately from each another. And those writing systems were but two of the ancient forms of writing that evolved independently. Over a span of two millenniums, two other powerful civilizations \\x97 the Chinese and Mayans \\x97 also identified and met a need for written communication. Writing came to China as early as around 1200 B.C. and to the Maya in Mesoamerica long before A.D. 500. “It was the first true information revolution,” Mr. Stein said. “By putting spoken language into material form, people could for the first time store and transmit it across time and space.” The Oriental Institute spent two years assembling the show, much of which comes from its own collections. However, it did borrow important Sumerian pieces from other institutions, including the clay tablet from the Vorderasiatisches Museum in Berlin, which has never before been seen in the United States.  The Oriental Institute, which opened in 1919, was heavily financed by John D. Rockefeller Jr., who had been greatly influenced by James Henry Breasted , a passionate archaeologist. Abby Rockefeller had read his best seller “Ancient Times” to her children.  Today the institute, which still has seven digs going on, boasts objects from excavations in Egypt, Israel, Syria, Turkey and Iraq. Many artifacts were acquired from joint digs with host countries with which the findings were shared. Among the institute’s prized holdings is a 40-ton winged bull from Khorsabad , the capital of Assyria, from around 715 B.C. The exhibition, which runs through March 6, focuses heavily on the Sumerian civilization that flourished between 3500 B.C. and 1800 B.C. in what is now southern Iraq. Until the 1950s experts had believed that the Sumerians influenced the Egyptians, spreading the use of writing westward. But in the 1950s Günther Dryer, a German archaeologist, found writing on bone and ivory tags in an elaborate, probably royal burial site at Abydos in southern Egypt. The depth at which they were buried and subsequent carbon tests proved the pieces to be as old as Sumerian works. Because the marks were different in style, scholars believe that the Egyptians developed their own writing system independently. Experts are still struggling to understand just how writing evolved, but one theory, laid out at the Oriental Institute’s exhibition, places the final prewriting stage at 3400 B.C., when the Sumerians first began using small clay envelopes like the ones in the show. Some of the envelopes had tiny clay balls sealed within. Archaeologists theorize that they were sent along with goods being delivered; recipients would open them and ensure that the number of receivables matched the number of clay tokens. The tokens, examples of which are also are in the show , transmitted information, a key function of writing. Writing as a carrier of narrative did not evolve for another 700 years, as shown in the inscribed versions of the Sumerian epic tale of Gilgamesh, also on display in the institute’s general collection. Although Egyptian hieroglyphics are more broadly familiar than cuneiform, Sumerian writing was done on clay, which is more durable than papyrus. As a result, Sumer is among the best documented of ancient societies. An important part of the Oriental Institute exhibition’s allure is that it describes some of the unknowns that still intrigue archaeologists, including the birth of the alphabet. The show includes a plaque dated from 1800 B.C. that contains signs that seem to be inspired by Egyptian hieroglyphics but that are actually the earliest letters of an alphabetic script representing Semitic languages. It was found near an ancient turquoise mining site in the Sinai Peninsula, in what was part of ancient Egypt, but the men who worked there spoke the Semitic language of the Canaanites. Because this is one of the first examples of the use of the alphabetic letters, it suggests that the alphabet was inspired by hieroglyphics. Still, no one really knows who the miners were, if they were literate or how they adapted hieroglyphics to write a western Semitic language. But in later discoveries those same forms make up parts of words.  An alphabetic language has a limited number of signs and is easier to both use and to teach than a representational system like hieroglyphics. An alphabet allows a more rapid spread of literacy and communications. Today almost all languages except Chinese and Japanese are alphabetic. The lack of an alphabet makes Chinese particularly difficult for foreigners. But if Chinese bears little similarity to languages elsewhere in the world, its origins \\x97 like the origins of hieroglyphics \\x97 have to do with the gods. Bones from ancient Chinese tombs, also on display at the Oriental, were used to help divine the future. The inscriptions on them are the earliest form of Chinese writing, and they make statements about events, such as a battle or the birth of a royal child, and also, in effect, ask how they will come out. Hot brands were put into hollows carved into turtle shells, and the configurations of the resulting cracks were interpreted as answers to important questions. Less is known about the earliest phases and origin of Mayan writing. Much of the work under way concentrates on artifacts from the Mayans’ later period, around A.D. 600. The exhibition includes a Mayan stone monument showing the face of a dead Mayan lord. It carries his name and the date of the dedication of the stone. To Christopher E. Woods, associate professor of Sumerology at the University of Chicago and the curator of the show, it was important to include examples from all four cultures because the goal of the exhibition was “to present and describe the four times in history when writing was invented from scratch.”', 'author': 'Geraldine Fabrikant', 'url': ['https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/arts/design/20writing.html'], 'tags': None, 'captions': ['A clay tag from around 3200 B.C. has signs that scholars call proto-cuneiform.', 'A Sumerian clay tablet from around 3200 B.C. is inscribed in wedgelike cuneiform with a list of professions.'], 'pubtime': datetime.datetime(2010, 10, 19, 0, 0), 'source': 'Nytimes_Arts'}\n",
      "{'title': 'A Fine View, on the Outside at Least (Published 2007)', 'unique_id': 1116, 'para': 'AKRON, Ohio, July 9 — The new addition to the Akron Museum of Art underscores how hard it can be to strike a balance between daring architecture and enjoyable spaces for viewing art. Designed by the Vienna-based Coop Himmelb(l)au, the building’s crystalline exterior and lobby, with their cascading sheets of glass, reflect an exuberant spirit of invention and openness. Unfortunately, that spirit stops at the gallery doors. After the initial euphoria of taking in the big public spaces, the galleries feel surprisingly drab. You’re left with the deflating impression that the client and the architect experienced a failure of nerve at the moment that mattered most. The old museum, housed in a 19th-century Renaissance Revival building that once served as a post office, stands on a commercial strip facing an ugly brick-clad parking structure in downtown Akron. This is the dark side of the America recalled by Robert Venturi: a haunted Main Street U.S.A. of decrepit brick buildings, vacant windows and empty storefronts. Coop Himmelb(l)au treats this history with just the right amount of respect, neither trying too hard to fit in with it nor begrudging its importance. The collection is divided into two parts, with late-19th-century and early-20th- century art housed in the old building and later-20th-century and contemporary art and photography displayed in a new one-story rectangular aluminum-clad slab just to the south. The two forms are joined by the imposing public lobby, its glass facade slanting back dramatically from the street to evoke a glistening mountainscape. Slim metal canopies, their sharp-edged forms resembling helicopter blades, cap the composition, anchoring the eye the way a cornice would in a classical building. Framed by the old brick structure at one end and the aluminum block on the other, the jostling glass forms suggest an impending explosion of pent-up energy. At street level, a section of the glass wall pops open to create the main entrance, Above, the lobby’s glass enclosure tilts back violently and then lurches out again over the roof of the brick building, as if it were cracking under some invisible strain. The sense of compression is more than a visual game. It is a deliberate tactic for injecting a fragment of urbanity — a hint of the social, ethnic and creative frictions that defined the 20th-century metropolis — into an otherwise lifeless Midwestern strip. Coop Himmelb(l)au clearly views the city as a place of intellectual freedom and creative ferment, and an antidote to the supposed repressive conformity of small-town America. That vision infuses the museum’s entire ground floor, which is meant to function as a social mixing space. The solid aluminum form that houses the galleries is raised one story above ground to make room for an outdoor cafe at the entry level. Inside the lobby, a grand staircase leads from the lobby to the second-floor galleries. A narrow bridge crosses the space, eventually joining the galleries to a library and administrative offices in the old building. One would have wished for more consistency in the detailing, which ranges from coarse to slightly fussy. Concrete surfaces are rough and uneven; the heavy beams that support the glass roof are crudely patched together with big steel plates. By contrast, the walkway’s aluminum cladding looks sleek and polished, as if the architects were aspiring for a higher level of refinement. The building would have been stronger if the detailing had simply been consistently tough. The lobby is nonetheless a terrific space, wonderfully alive. It’s only when you enter the new galleries that the life seems to drain out of the architecture. The art is presented in a lifeless sequence of interchangeable rooms painted in muddy colors. But what is most disheartening is the light. By lifting the gallery level into the air, the architects lead us to anticipate an intuitive sequence up toward the sunlight. Instead, you enter a blank box. There are no skylights, no effort to bring natural light down into the rooms. (Admittedly, the effect is not aided by the uneven 20th-century collection, which ranges from a subversively decorative work by Lari Pittman to a Warhol Elvis to a mix of lesser works by local artists.) Who knows why it worked out this way. Fear, possibly. The notion that flashy architecture overpowers the art has become one of the most stubborn clichés of the museum world. And in recent decades curators and conservators have increasingly sounded the alarm that excessive light destroys valuable art. But the most skillful architects have figured out how to balance these concerns. Look at Steven Holl’s luminous new addition to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo. By contrast, the Akron museum’s galleries show that a stifled imagination can do more harm than a splash of vulgarity.', 'author': 'Nicolai Ouroussoff', 'url': ['https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/14/arts/design/14coop.html'], 'tags': None, 'captions': ['At the Akron Museum of Art, a new glass lobby joins the museum\\x92s old brick building and the aluminum-clad addition.'], 'pubtime': datetime.datetime(2007, 7, 14, 0, 0), 'source': 'Nytimes_Arts'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Conservative Politician Demands Removal of Sexual Mandala, Gallery Refuses', 'unique_id': 140633, 'para': 'At first glance, French Canadian artist Rosalie Maheux ‘s artwork displayed in the lobby of a government office building in Toronto resembles a kaleidoscopic mandala composed of harmless, symmetric shapes. A closer look at the nearly three foot by three foot picture, however, reveals that it is composed of photographs of naked women engaged in sexually explicit acts, images that have prompted Ontario’s Progressive Conservative party to call for the work’s removal. As the Globe and Mail  reported , the party considers Maheux’s “Sacred Circle VI” (2014) inappropriate art to hang in a government building. The piece is on view as part of John B. Aird Gallery ‘s current exhibition highlighting 30 artists under the age of 30, which opened at the end of June and runs through July 24. Although the Ontario government provides the exhibition space, community volunteers and representatives from four art societies direct it. Still, Progressive Conservative member Laurie Scott said she was “disappointed” by the display of such provocative images in a government office, finding them demeaning. “Regardless of the aims or intent of the artist, Ontarians expect their government to lead by example in combating the sexual objectification of women,” Scott said in a statement. “The fact that a publicly housed gallery has been allowed to not only display but to sell images of this nature is very worrisome.” “Sacred Circle VI” is just one such work in a series that Maheux began in 2012 and is intended to initiate conversations about the objectification of women. In a statement released over the weekend, Maheux described the series as a social critique of the excessive value that society places on women’s sexual attractiveness. Given these standards, as a woman artist it only makes sense that I would take the images of women that are out there, including the sexualized and the pornographic, reconfigure them on my own terms, and offer them back as something transformed. Her adoption of the mandala is particularly significant to her for its sacred symbolism of “life, purity, and the glorification of god in many cultures and religions,” which clashes with the profanity of the explicit imagery from which she makes it. In an email to Hyperallergic, Maheux said she was surprised by Scott’s reaction, particularly by the politician’s statement that she did not care about the artist’s intentions. “So that sort of defeats the purpose of contemporary art,” Maheux wrote. “What a thing to say regarding a conceptual artwork intended to promote dialogue about the representation of sexuality in our society … because she did not see the work, did not want to hear about it, I think her comment on objectification of women regarding my work is misunderstood. “The irony of the Conservative reaction to the piece is that the denotative significance of the imagery sends them into a puritanical frenzy, unable and unwilling in the case of the MPP [Member of Provincial Parliament] Scott to think about the work,” she continued. While the Conservatives cited “recent public outcry” over crimes such as sexual harassment and human trafficking as reasons to remove works that objectify women, the collage will remain on view at the gallery, which said in a statement that it does not censor images in support of artistic freedom of expression. Curator Gary Michael Dault had chosen the work “for its inventive, thoughtful, and searching nature,” the statement explained. John B. Aird Gallery has since posted notices at the exhibition’s entrance warning viewers that the show contains “images intended for a mature audience.” Notably, the controversial mandala is not Maheux’s only work in the show that explores themes of sexuality. “Impress the Reaper,” a life-size sculpture of a coffin bent into the shape of a rainbow, is meant to allude to Freud’s theory of Eros and Thanatos. The sculpture, she explained, proposes an orgasmic end to life rather than the traditionally somber funeral practices and riffs on the euphemism “ la petite mort .” “Once again, this piece is about sex! Pure sex!” Maheux told Hyperallergic. “But I guess the sexual nature of this piece was not clear to [the Conservatives], and they were unable to stop looking at some genitals in the other corner of the gallery.”', 'author': 'Claire Voon', 'url': None, 'tags': None, 'captions': ['Rosalie Maheux, “Sacred Circle VI” (2014) (courtesy the artist)', 'Similar works from Maheux’s “Sacred Circle” series (photo via', ')', 'Rosalie Maheux, “Impress the Reaper” (2015) (photo via', ')'], 'pubtime': datetime.datetime(2015, 7, 20, 0, 0), 'source': 'Hyperallergic'}\n",

The court found that the three person board paid themselves “suspicious” six figure sums in 2012. According to Austrian daily Der Standard , the board members voted themselves onto the board of “Franz West Werknutzungs GmbH,” a subsidiary company of the Franz West Private Foundation which received payments from the sale of West’s works. The board subsequently paid themselves salaries totaling over €500,000 ($563,425) over a period of five months. In 2013, the board again made payments of over €800,000 ($901,480) to four “employees.” The Supreme Court ruled that the payments amounted to a self-beneficial business arrangement that shouldn’t have been approved. The court’s judgement, however, is not final. The motion for the dismissal of the board members was filed by West’s widow Tamuna Sirbiladze  before she unexpectedly died in March . Since West’s death in 2012, the Franz West Archive and the Franz West Private Foundation have laid claim to the artist’s multi-million dollar estate. West founded the Franz West Private Foundation only five days before his death, effectively diverting all royalties, copyrights, and assets away from his family and the non-profit Franz West Archive, which was founded in 2002. Since the artist’s death, the Archive has been trying to regain control by launching a number of lawsuits against the Foundation and the dealers it works with . According to the artist’s family, West was no longer of sound mind when he founded the Private Foundation. West is considered one of Austria’s most significant contemporary artists.

      "{'title': 'Art and the Politics of Acceptance: A Conversation With Peter Selz', 'unique_id': 122801, 'para': 'Peter Selz — prolific curator, art historian, and an instrumental figure in the scholarship on modern art — hardly bears introduction. Last year, the University of California Press published his biography, Paul J. Karlstrom’s Peter Selz: Sketches of a Life in Art , to general acclaim in the academic and popular press. Currently a resident of Berkeley, California, where he is an emeritus professor in the history of art at the University of California, Selz returned to New York last month to curate a show by Yisrael “Kenny” Feldsott at Studio Vendome , a comfortably sized gallery on the ground floor of Philip Johnson’s “Urban Glass House” residential tower on Spring Street. The show, entitled Cries, Chants, Shouts and Whispers: Songs of the Forgotten , features Feldsott’s primitivist, politically anguished paintings. In our wide-ranging discussion, Selz spoke to his interest in Feldsott’s painterly preoccupation with humanity’s “continued brutality,” and more broadly about his life, his position on so-called political art, and how the art world has become “a world of acceptance.” *  *  * Mostafa Heddaya : How did you first encounter Kenny Feldsott’s work? Peter Selz : I saw him in a San Francisco gallery. I had never heard of him. The gallery was in Pacific Heights, the Paul Mahder Gallery . I was simply astonished … You don’t see work like this everyday. MH : You also teach at UC Berkeley, correct? What is it like transitioning from curatorial work to academic work? PS : I’ve always done both. I’ve always gone back and forth and back and forth. For many years Berkeley had the largest university museum in the country. But it was new when I started. But I did it at the same time: I curated shows then and taught in the history of art department. So I’ve always gone back and forth. Before that I was at the Museum of Modern Art, and before that I was teaching at Pomona College. [Prior to that] I was teaching at the Institute of Design, the “New Bauhaus,” in Chicago. That was my first teaching job. And I did that after I finished my doctorate at the University of Chicago. MH : I’m curious what your approach was to curating this show, since you’ve inaugurated spaces before, like at UC Berkeley, and Studio Vendome is a new gallery. How is curating a show for a newer space different from curating for an established one? PS : That really wouldn’t be all that different. When you curate a show, first you have to decide what you’re going to curate. This artist or group of artists who’s in the show. That’s the main decision. At MoMA, for instance, my first show was called New Images of Man . It became an important show … I think one of the first artist solo shows I did in New York was the Mark Rothko show. He had never had a museum show; he was not all that well known at the time. This was 1961, I think. So you decide on what artist or artists you want to do a show. A relatively well-known artist or a hardly known artist, because you see the work as real, real quality and should be shown. And then the curating simply consists of selecting the best work. It doesn’t really matter if the show could have been at an established space. It could have been a museum show. And we did have that show, a larger version [of the Feldsott show] in a more established gallery in San Francisco. Before it came here. That gallery actually had three floors. MH : What specifically about Feldsott’s work is most interesting to you? PS : It’s his combination of rawness. And the subjects he chooses are raw and brutal. So he has this raw brutality, which he then executes with the expertise of a really excellent painter. You know, he’s been painting for 40 years. So it’s this combination of his primitive rawness, in a way, and his consummate skill. So it comes across as powerful work. I would say it’s an engagement of politics and a commitment to art. MH : In your book German Expressionist Painting , you quote Kokoschka: “Expressionism does not live in an ivory tower.” What does it mean for art to be engaged or political? PS : Well, everything you do is political. In the case of Feldsott, the brutality, the continued brutality of the human race. But much of my work has been not at all political. My last book — I’ve done about 20 books — my last book was called Art of Engagement . That was the first time I wrote a book on political art … What you think about [political art]? MH : I think my interest in political art is related to the question of whether a mere aesthetic awareness can be political, or if we must envision an artistic practice oriented around action to produce truly political art. And I’m curious what you think about how the events of the the latter half of the 20th century, particularly the 1960s and 70s, might have redefined political art as a sort of a political act in and of itself. PS : Well, there’s a lot of this kind of “punk art” or whatever that comes back. But I really don’t know very much about that. It’s really not what I’ve been engaged in. I’m not that much involved in political action. I think that the person who is primarily involved in political action can’t really be a great artist. Being a sculptor or a painter is indeed a full-time job. And the artist can be engaged in political problems — but if you want to really engage in political action, that’s a different road. I don’t think that Feldsott is engaged in political action. Although the trip he took across the country was very much an action trip … He made all these stops. And that, in a way, was political. MH : Since you organized the great “Symposium on Pop Art” at MoMA in 1962, I am interested to know whether you believe that there’s enough critical dialogue, especially at large institutions, on contemporary art practice? PS : My feeling about Pop art was it really undermined most art movements until that time. It was really the first modern art movement that I can think of — the Cubists, and the Expressionists, and the Futurists, and the Surrealists, and the Abstract Expressionists, all these movements questioned the establishment. And Pop art I think was the first movement which embraced the establishment. Instead of saying, “Look at this miserable consumer society we live in,” it was, “Look how nice the consumer society is.” And it was also, as far as I know, the first art movement in which the artists made money as soon as they began to show their work. People would buy Rosenquists, Lichtensteins, and Warhols. It was an acceptance of the bourgeoisie. That’s one reason I didn’t care for it. It was a politics of acceptance. MH : At the time, in 1962, you used the platform that you had to organize a critical dialogue on this subject. But do you think the institutions of art today are equipped to engage in this kind of studied refusal? PS : Not any more. Very little. The art world has changed enormously. The art world has become the world of acceptance, it’s become part of the larger consumer society. I dont see very many places that really question authority at this point. And when I see an artist like this [Feldsott], he certainly does, he does engage this. MH : What institutions do you think remain engaged, if any? Are there any that remain in your esteem? I know that you’re involved with the Neue Gallery. PS : Yes but … they do, you know, a Kandinsky show… Mr. Lauder certainly does not question authority [laughs]. They may show art that was at its time very revolutionary in fact, but it’s now total acceptance. You know when I did the Jean Tinguely self-destroying machine at the Museum of Modern Art in 1960, that was a question. It really questioned the authority of art itself. Now it’s totally accepted. Now they can do a Tinguely show. But that kind of rebellion doesn’t exist now. Everything’s been co-opted by something. [ Editor’s note: For more on Selz’s involvement with the Tinguely show, see page 25 of this archival MoMA interview . ] MH : Do you think the incorporation of oppositional artists into the museum has co-opted this culture? PS : I think so. I really don’t see much opposition art at this point. Certainly not in this country. MH : Do you believe that that oppositional culture exists elsewhere in the world? PS : Probably. I don’t see things like that. Years ago there were the Vienna Action Group , people like this. I don’t see anything like that happening now. And also, everything has become so global … the culture has become one of global art. I’ve always from the very beginning said that I look at art in the context of the political world. I always took a great separation from the people — let’s say like Clement Greenberg, who looked at art only as formal statement. He would say he’s not interested in the political aspect. He’s not interested in the life of the artist. The work of the art by itself as a formal statement. But I think this is nonsense. The artist worked in a political framework. From the very beginning, when I wrote the German Expressionist book, I looked at their movement in terms of the whole economic, political environment in which it was created. I was early, early on — I looked at art in that kind of context. But many of my colleagues were involved in more formalist attitudes. Yisrael K.

      "{'title': 'A Finer Haute Cuisine (Published 2009)', 'unique_id': 65809, 'para': 'MODICA, ITALY — There’s a fine line between showing off culinary skill to its best advantage and simply showing off. It’s collaboration versus exhibitionism. And it looks as though the former is winning, to judge by some interesting tableware that’s making an appearance in a number of Italy’s top restaurants. “I’ve always paid particular attention to how a dish looks. But within limits,” said Ciccio Sultano, chef and owner of the two-Michelin-star restaurant Duomo in Ragusa, in Sicily. “I think restaurants went overboard with all those signature dishes that had more to do with architecture than food. I’m currently working on a range of glass plates and dishes with a craftsman who is also a bit of a gourmand. He understands exactly how to set off my sort of creative cuisine.” The food-loving artisan in question is Alessandro Di Rosa, whose designs for glassware are delighting chefs well beyond his native Sicily. For Mr. Sultano he has created different-shaped plates with a textured transparent glass rim and a slightly off-center patch of color that captures and underscores sauce. Next in line is a series of glass tasting spoons, so that customers can sample a wide range of the restaurant’s specialties rather than opt for the classic antipasto, pasta and meat course of traditional Italian cuisine. Mr. Di Rosa, who hails from the handsome baroque town of Modica, created some of his earliest products for a local temple of gastronomy: the Antica Dolceria Bonajuto, a place of pilgrimage for those with a sweet tooth. The Dolceria is renowned for its traditional Sicilian cannoli, which have a crunchy cylindrical shell filled with chocolate or sweet ricotta. Mr. Di Rosa explains with a glint in his eyes: “A few years ago I realized that customers wishing to eat one on the premises — and they included me — needed a specially designed plate, something worthy of the delicacy that would ensure no fragments fell and were wasted. I made a few samples and showed them to the proprietor, Franco Ruta. I’ve been making tasting plates of various shapes and sizes for them ever since.” This year, Mr. Di Rosa came out with Thalass (www.thalass.it), his first collection of glass plates, bowls and tasting dishes devised and designed for people who appreciate that the first organ of taste is the eye, followed by the nose and then the palate. Though each item is handmade, the technology is advanced enough to give high standards of performance. These plates resist unsightly fingerprints, are safe in industrial dishwashers and are far less likely to chip or crack than terra cotta or porcelain. The secret lies in the way they are produced. Each plate has two parts, both made from high-quality plate glass. One part is hand painted with the requisite color and pattern, using ceramic glazes that provide brilliant, compact hues. The glaze is bonded with the glass in a kiln for 22 hours at 700 degrees Celsius (1,300 degrees Fahrenheit), and the colored element is then fused with the part that provides the overall shape during a further 22-hour firing at 810 degrees Celsius, sandwiching the glaze between layers of glass so that it never comes into contact with the food. To create the desired shape, molds are hand cut from refractory ceramic fiber whose deliberate roughness lends texture to the finished product. These molds are placed in flat kilns, and the two layers of glass are placed on top of them. At high temperatures the glass becomes so ductile that the layers amalgamate and take on the shape of the underlying form. “I don’t really do quantity,” Mr. Di Rosa said. “In fact, I’m in my element producing 50 to 100 of a particular piece, which is something no one else will do. For restaurateurs this is ideal. It means we can work together on a custom-made collection that really suits what they are serving.” Mr. Di Rosa promotes his work by eating at restaurants of chefs he admires, studying the dishes they create and how they serve them, then going back to his workshop and coming up with designs to propose. This has led him to collaborations with quiet icons of gastronomic excellence like Pino Cuttaia of the Michelin-starred La Madia in Licata, in southwest Sicily, and the internationally celebrated Carlo Cracco of Cracco Peck in Milan. Given his beginnings and his penchant for pastries, Mr. Di Rosa also visits cafes and ice cream parlors of note. Foremost among these is Caffè Sicilia in Noto, in southeast Sicily, where Corrado Assenza purveys sweetmeats of magical creativity. Grasping the potential of transparent glass embellished with light brushstrokes of color, Mr. Assenza recently rearranged the cafe’s acclaimed Time of Rest dessert to suit a plate of textured glass embellished with an off-center disk of orangey-yellow. “We usually serve this concoction of sweet black rice, a thin, almost creamy gelatin of green tea and a more consistent jasmine gelatin in a plastic glass,” he said. “Displaying it on the plate made for a much lighter, more elegant and airy effect. And this got us thinking.” Mr. Di Rosa is working on a unique series of plates and dishes for Caffè Sicilia. For his part, Mr. Assenza is perfecting the new desserts that will be displayed on them. For now, it’s top secret, he said. “You’ll just have to come by in a couple of months’ time to sample our creations.” All in the line of duty, of course.', 'author': None, 'url': ['https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/arts/25iht-fglass.html'], 'tags': None, 'captions': ['Ciccio Sultano, the chef and owner of the two-Michelin-star restaurant Duomo in Ragusa, in Sicily.

Titled ''Weeping,'' it is brief but potent. Nearly identical images appear on screens, beginning with a pulsating aura of fiery light, like a slow-motion image of a solar flare. From its center a man's face materializes. Youngish with a 1970's haircut and an unwavering gaze (he is played by Mr. Melhus), he might be a lounge singer or a game-show host. Then he starts to speak in a mechanical voice pitched unnaturally high. At first the two faces alternate lines in tense, clipped syncopation; then in unison and with disjointed phrases -- ''blow the trumpets,'' ''weeping, weeping, weeping'' -- they describe a picture of punishing, apocalyptic destruction with mounting urgency before their faces dissolve back into the light. Mr. Melhus is playing off the tradition of the televangelist; in fact, the words he uses are lifted from the Trinity Broadcast Network. As a cultural type, such a figure is easy to send up, but Mr. Melhus does something more than that. He makes his preacher seem at once absurd and demonic. The voice of fanaticism delivering a picture of mass destruction may still be just ideological theatrics, but it carries a sense of threat it didn't have a few years ago, and Mr. Melhus distills that here.

      "{'title': \"BALLET REVIEW; 'Swan Lake' Moves Inside, Décor by Degas (Published 2004)\", 'unique_id': 66711, 'para': \"Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov knew best when they choreographed their version of Tchaikovsky's ''Swan Lake'' in 1895. But among those who insist on departing from that touchstone original, Christopher Wheeldon can now lay claim to one of the most compelling alternative versions with his new staging of ''Swan Lake'' for the Pennsylvania Ballet. It is no surprise that Mr. Wheeldon, resident choreographer at New York City Ballet, is again brimming with dance ideas and stunning images. Still, the ballet's premiere over the weekend at the Academy of Music here opened with an unexpected scene: a clear allusion to a Degas ballet painting. This time around the conceit is that a male dancer in a Degas-like studio is portraying Prince Siegfried in a rehearsal. À la Stanislavsky, he identifies with his role and becomes Siegfried. Reality and fantasy blur. Like Rudolf Nureyev, Mr. Wheeldon has set ''Swan Lake'' inside a room, suggesting that the lakeside encounters of Odette, the swan queen, and Prince Siegfried, as protagonist, are projections of the hero's mind. But in the end the male dancer returns to reality. Definitely not Siegfried and back in the classroom, he does a double take when he sees his ballerina as herself. For all the patches of shaky dramaturgy, Mr. Wheeldon conveys nothing heavy and something highly imaginative. Here again, as he did in ''Scènes de Ballet'' and ''Variations Sérieuses'' at City Ballet, he is fascinated with the way dancers train and perform. Here again, he mixes the humorous and the serious. He has rechoreographed a hilarious floor show for the ballroom scene, in which Odile, Odette's evil double, seduces Siegfried. But this masked ball is the reality that the hero encounters. Among rich roués, the members of the Jockey Club who acquired mistresses from the Paris Opera Ballet, the man in the top hat and tails from a Degas painting becomes the stand-in for Rothbart, the evil magician. This masked opera ball is all too real, full of decadence and brilliantly summed up in the divertissement: a Russian dance that becomes a strip tease, an invasion of can-can girls (dancing to the tarantella!), and best of all, an overcooked Spanish dance for a smirking and shoving trio. Before you can say Matthew Bourne and recall his so-called male ''Swan Lake,'' the thing to remember is that Mr. Wheeldon has retained the main pieces of choreography by Petipa and Ivanov (Mr. Bourne did not) and that his sendup of the Act III character dances is not a sendup of ''Swan Lake'' as a whole. Part of Mr. Wheeldon's ruling conceit is that the fantasy characters are real people the protagonist encounters in his life. Thus the Patron, elegant in tails, is transformed into Rothbart as a tramp in tattered coat, stalking the swans in the dreamlike lakeside scenes. Thanks to an ingenious combination of décor, lighting and choreography, the ballet studio onstage becomes a magical place of astonishing visual impact. Mr. Wheeldon has assembled a crack team that has worked on Broadway and in dance. Adrianne Lobel's sets begin with a screen that suggests a fragment of a ballet studio. There are a barre and a bench for the Degas girls, wearing Jean-Marc Puissant's beautiful knee-length tutus and neck ribbons. When the screen rises, Ms. Lobel offers a big room with three sets of French doors (as in Degas's pictures), a huge tarnished mirror and ballet barres along the side walls, which have more portals. The white-and-gray wallpaper is transformed into different colors, often green and blue, by Natasha Katz's spectacular lighting, and James Buckhouse's projections introduce a moving flock of swans on those walls. Much of Mr. Wheeldon's theatricality comes from the brilliance with which he moves the dancers in and out of the set's openings. The wallpaper becomes translucent, and the swans are seen dancing behind the walls as well as in front of them. What is a room? What is a lake? In Act IV the back wall disappears to reveal an expanse of waves. In Act III the waltzing guests at the ball are seen through a mirror, and Odile enters through a door in that mirror. Musically, Mr. Wheeldon has cut transitional passages considerably. The idea is to plunge directly into the action. On Sunday afternoon Mr. Wheeldon's primary cast was led by Riolama Lorenzo, a sensuous Odette and Odile who brought out the traditional emotional nuances through her expressive dancing, and Zachary Hench, whose Siegfried acted ardently and danced with impressive precision in Act III. Alexei Charov was eye-catching as a decidedly crazed Rothbart. On Saturday night Arantxa Ochoa and James Ady, like Meredith Rainey's sinister Rothbart, were more straightforward. The passion here was less evident, but Ms. Ochoa's individuality makes even her pure-dance approach interesting. Mr. Wheeldon's new choreography is better in Acts I and III than in Act IV. Elsewhere he has taken some liberties with structure. In Act II Odette's solo comes before her pas de deux with the prince. Dramatically this is a loss, since Ivanov's dances for the corps and the four cygnets (splendidly danced by Laura Bowman, Charity Eagens, Jessica Gattinella and Jennifer Smith) and the shift in Odette's solo sequence delay the idea that any romance has developed between Odette and Siegfried. And although Mr. Wheeldon makes clear in a program note that he does not want the prince to swear his love to Odette in Act II, it is then unclear why the hero's infatuation with Odile at the ball is a betrayal of his fantasy Odette. These are dramatic glitches that may seem minor when compared with the high level of choreography on view, both old and new. But when the drama comes to the fore, it needs some logic. Still, the choreography is thrilling. Under Roy Kaiser's artistic direction, the Pennsylvania Ballet has risen to the occasion of Mr. Wheeldon's technical demands. Even the can-can girls show off their rumps merrily. No wonder Siegfried or his alter ego wants out. But audiences should want in when the performances resume on Wednesday, continuing through Sunday afternoon.\", 'author': 'Anna Kisselgoff', 'url': ['https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/08/arts/ballet-review-swan-lake-moves-inside-decor-by-degas.html'], 'tags': None, 'captions': None, 'pubtime': datetime.datetime(2004, 6, 8, 0, 0), 'source': 'Nytimes_Arts'}\n",

Bandits, illness and cold. Travel was a grueling affair in the 18th century, but it was something Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart did for most of his life: he was a traveling salesman of the sublime. Consider that he left home with his family at age 7 and remained on the road for 3 years, 5 months and 20 days. The Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center has seized on this theme as an organizing principle for its 39th season, which opens on July 28. Programs are built, sometimes pretty loosely, around Mozart\\'s stays in Paris, London, Italy and Prague. The concerts and lectures are presented under the rubric \"Arrivals and Departures: Traveling With Mozart.\" The concept exemplifies the effort that a mostly one-composer festival must make to stay fresh yet true to its mission. The perennial struggle to navigate between being too academic and too shallow intersects with the need to juggle the competing demands of soloists and programmers. This festival has stretched the concept so much that several concerts revolve around Russia, a land Mozart never even visited (although he thought about doing so toward the end of his life, according to the Mozart scholar Alfred Einstein). \"We embrace our elasticity,\" said Jane S. Moss, the vice president for programming at Lincoln Center, who devised the programs in collaboration with Louis Langrée, the festival\\'s music director. \"The theme is Mozart as related to these cities or countries, but it also is about creating a musical portrait above and beyond Mozart of those cities,\" Ms. Moss said in a recent interview. \"It not incidentally creates a more varied musical palette for the festival, which is nice.\" The Paris concerts, for example, include a program (Aug. 5 and 6) with the Symphony No. 31, the \"Paris\"; the Concerto for flute and harp, which Mozart composed in Paris; and Ravel\\'s Piano Concerto in G, written 140 years after Mozart\\'s death. Mr. Langrée said by telephone from France that Ravel had called the concerto\\'s slow movement a homage to Mozart. Ravel was said to have viewed the piece in the brilliant and light spirit of Mozart and Saint-Saëns. Other Paris programs have works by composers Mozart \"may have heard\" in Paris, festival material says, like Jean-Philippe Rameau and Jean-Marie Leclair. The Prague-related concerts (Aug. 9 and 10) include the \"Prague\" Symphony, No. 38, and the overture to \"Don Giovanni,\" which had its premiere in Prague. But late-night concerts on those evenings feature the Tokyo String Quartet playing Dvorak and Smetana along with Mozart. The mix is designed to give a flavor of Bohemia, Mr. Langrée said. The Freiburg Baroque Orchestra of Germany will do a solid Italy-related program (Aug. 14): works by Johann Adolf Hasse and Giovanni Battista Sammartini, maestros active in Italy who were known to Mozart (he particularly admired Hasse); the Symphony in D (K. 97), written in Rome; \"Exsultate, Jubilate,\" written in Milan; and arias from two operas commissioned in Italy, \"Mitridate, rè di Ponto\" and \"Lucio Silla.\" Mozart spent 15 months in England during that first childhood grand tour. He composed his Symphony No. 1 there. The Gabrieli Consort, led by Paul McCreesh, will play it in a program (Aug. 11) that includes songs by the mostly London-based Johann Christian Bach, a strong influence on Mozart; Thomas Linley, the English violinist Mozart befriended in Florence, who died at 21; and Stephen Storace, part of a group of expatriate Britons Mozart knew in Vienna. Another London program (Aug. 12 and 13) illustrates the difficulty of matching concept to performer. Mr. Langrée will conduct the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra in J.C. Bach\\'s Symphony in G minor; a tenor aria composed in London, \"Va, dal furor portata\"; Haydn\\'s \"London\" Symphony; and Beethoven\\'s Piano Concerto No. 1. The Beethoven has no connection to Mozart. But the soloist, Garrick Ohlsson, insisted on playing it, Mr. Langrée said, gamely observing that the concerto was apparently the first Beethoven piece performed in London. On the other hand, for opening night, the soprano Renée Fleming was persuaded to sing Mozart\\'s aria with recitative \"Bella mia fiamma Resta, o cara\" because it was written in Prague. Mozart composed it for Josefa Dusek, a soprano and rumored love interest whom he often saw in the city. Dusek, according to Mozart family lore, had to lock him in a cottage to get him to finish it. The Russia-themed concerts (Aug. 16 and 17) flowed partly from a desire by Mr. Langrée to conduct Prokofiev\\'s \"Classical\" Symphony, Ms. Moss said. As the festival conveys it, the piece is classical; Mozart is Classical; so the piece is related to Mozart. Also on the same program are Alfred Schnittke\\'s \"Moz-Art à la Haydn\" and Tchaikovsky\\'s Violin Concerto, with Joshua Bell as soloist. Ms. Moss said that Mr. Bell did not want to play a Mozart concerto, but he had agreed to the Tchaikovsky with an orchestra smaller than usual (thus more Mozartean). Mr. Langrée pointed out that the concerto was composed shortly after Tchaikovsky received an edition of the complete works of Mozart, whom he worshiped. \"The concept ends up being an essay in free association,\" Maynard Solomon, the author of an acclaimed 1995 biography of Mozart, said of some of the programs. \"But that\\'s O.K. It sounds like it\\'s going to be great fun.\" Mr. Solomon noted that Mozart\\'s travels are a rich vein in Mozart scholarship and are crucial to understanding his essence as a composer. As he grew up and moved from city to city, Mozart absorbed the talent around him, sometimes composing in the local style to please local audiences, and emulsified these styles into his own genius. The journeys were a source of income, recognition and musical inspiration. Being on the road with his violinist father as tutor, particularly on the grand tour from age 7 to 10, amounted to his elementary-school education, musical and otherwise. \"He got a sense of appreciation that was quite extraordinary,\" Mr. Solomon said of that first phenomenally successful tour, which was essentially a family enterprise. \"For a child to be at the center of that is extraordinary and indescribable.\" Even when Mozart settled in Vienna for the final decade of his life, he moved at least 11 times, suggesting that constant movement was a natural state, even an artistic need. \"Mozart was engaged in a continuing romance with the world,\" Mr. Solomon wrote in his biography, \"which unfolded its wonders to him and rendered him its tributes.\"', 'author': 'Daniel J.

      "{'title': 'Jan Kott, 87, Critic and Shakespeare Scholar (Published 2002)', 'unique_id': 86713, 'para': \"Jan Kott, a Polish-American theater critic and expert on Shakespeare whose theories influenced some of the most innovative of modern theater directors, died on Dec. 22 in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 87 and formerly lived in Stony Brook, N.Y. Mr. Kott was one of a handful of theater critics who have changed the perception of masterpieces. His main strong point as a critic lay in his skill at showing ''the way in which the history is part of the drama and the drama is part of the history,'' as he put it in a 1985 interview. In his influential book ''Shakespeare Our Contemporary'' (1964, Doubleday), ''Kott sees Shakespeare in the light of our world, or, more pointedly and poignantly, in the light of his world,'' Harold Clurman, a director, drama critic and author on theater, wrote in a review of the work in The New York Times Book Review. ''Being a Pole whose country suffered more than any other the holocaust of Nazism and later the oppression of Stalinism, Kott's vision of our era is infernal.'' In the book, Mr. Kott revealed an artistic relationship between William Shakespeare and Samuel Beckett. That insight, in a 1962 French translation of the book, greatly influenced Peter Brook's 1964 production of Shakespeare's ''King Lear,'' starring Paul Scofield. In that production, King Lear is alone on the heath like a figure out of Beckett's ''Waiting for Godot.'' Mr. Kott also helped shape the work of directors like Giorgio Strehler and Ariane Mnouchkine. ''For me, theater is the Event,'' he said in the 1985 interview, when he was 70. ''It is not abstract. It is part of life, and it is connected with my personal history. I lived the life of the theater.'' ''The play, the three hours in the theater, is just a short moment,'' he added. ''And backstage is always as important as the stage.'' In his collection of essays, ''The Bottom Translation: Marlowe and Shakespeare and the Carnival Tradition'' (1987, Northwestern), ''Mr. Kott takes the concept of 'chronotope,' the joining of time and space, basic to the theorizing of the Russian literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin and extends it, contemplating the causal and temporal connections between masterpieces,'' Mel Gussow of The Times wrote in the Book Review. In the 1985 interview, Mr. Kott, who was also a dramaturge, said, ''The most exciting time in my life was cooperating on productions with Peter Brook and Giorgio Strehler,'' and the ideal relationship was to be ''a dramaturge for the great directors.'' Born in Warsaw, he studied at the universities of Warsaw, Paris and Lodz. He returned to Poland shortly before World War II and was drafted into the Polish army. Later he was in the underground Resistance against the German occupiers of Poland. He joined the Polish Communist Party during the war and quit after 14 years. After teaching Polish literary history at the University of Warsaw and being a visiting professor at Yale, he lost the Warsaw teaching post on political grounds. He was granted asylum in the United States in 1969, by which time he had become known in Europe for his writings about Shakespeare. He taught courses involving drama, English and literature at the State University of New York at Stony Brook from 1969 to 1983, when he retired. He married Lidia Steinhaus in 1939. She died in 2000. Surviving are a son, Michael, of Pelham, N.Y. and Washington; a daughter, Teresa Berger of Boston; and four grandchildren.\", 'author': 'Eric Pace', 'url': ['https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/04/arts/jan-kott-87-critic-and-shakespeare-scholar.html'], 'tags': None, 'captions': None, 'pubtime': datetime.datetime(2002, 1, 4, 0, 0), 'source': 'Nytimes_Arts'}\n",
